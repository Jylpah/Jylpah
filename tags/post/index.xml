      <description>Now there is evidence (for Mad &amp;amp; Burning Games).
Few weeks back I opened Discord to find out how someone had sent me tens of messages saying he thinks &amp;ldquo;WG is rigging the Burning Games MM&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>Updated 2020-08-11
Over-Powered (OP) tanks are maybe the 2nd most popular topic on Blitz YouTube videos and online chats - right after &amp;ldquo;the Matchmaker&amp;rdquo;. I have long held the view that if a tank is &amp;ldquo;OP&amp;rdquo;, this has to be visible in statistics.</description>

      <description>Added stats for update 7.0. Interestingly, the player base tracked played far less battles during the update compared to the previous update despite the update interval being very long due to the WG release schedule.</description>

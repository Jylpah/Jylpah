      <description>Final stats for update 7.8 have been added.
  In total, there were 169M battles by 483k players recorded in the database during the update 7.8.
  It is getting boring the report the best performing tanks - the same ones keep topping the charts update after update in slightly different order: 1) T28 Concept, 2) Object 252U, 3) Annihilator, 4) T54E2 and 5) Maus.</description>

      <title>Vehicle Class (Im)Balance</title>
      <link>https://blitzanalysiz.com/blog/2021-03-13_vehicle_class_imbalance/</link>

      <guid>https://blitzanalysiz.com/blog/2021-03-13_vehicle_class_imbalance/</guid>
      <description>I my view, the game became more boring after WG added Vehicle Class Matching rules into the MatchMaker (update 5.1). The exact vehicle class matching rules have been adjusted since, but basically the Vehicle Class Matching limits the number of Tank Destroyers and Light Tanks per team and makes sure there is only +/-1 tank difference between the teams across the vehicle classes.</description>

      <description>A fellow tanker asked a simple question of &amp;ldquo;what is the most OP regular tank in Blitz of all time?&amp;rdquo;. A fair question and something I would have not been able to guess.</description>

      <description>Updated 2020-08-11
Over-Powered (OP) tanks are maybe the 2nd most popular topic on Blitz YouTube videos and online chats - right after &amp;ldquo;the Matchmaker&amp;rdquo;. I have long held the view that if a tank is &amp;ldquo;OP&amp;rdquo;, this has to be visible in statistics.</description>

      <description>Stats for update 6.10 has been added to the site. How did the ATGM tanks actually perform? Did Sheridan deserve its nerf in 7.0? Was T92E1 still one of the best performing tier IX tanks?</description>

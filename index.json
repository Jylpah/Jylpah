That is the average of players' WR in a tank compared to their average WR at the tier (in all same tier tanks). Relative WR is a measure of the performance/strength of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 8.4 only. The impact of &ldquo;Stock-grind battles&rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players&rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier.

That is the average of players' WR in a tank compared to their average WR at the tier (in all same tier tanks). Relative WR is a measure of the performance/strength of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 8.4 only. The impact of &ldquo;Stock-grind battles&rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players' average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players' performance in the same tier tanks.

    "content": "The Best Performing Tanks Highest Relative WR The graph shows the tanks with the highest Relative WR. That is the average of players' WR in a tank compared to their average WR at the tier (in all same tier tanks). Relative WR is a measure of the performance/strength of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 8.4 only. The impact of &ldquo;Stock-grind battles&rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players&rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier.

That is the average of players' WR in a tank compared to their average WR at the tier (in all same tier tanks). Relative WR is a measure of the performance/strength of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 8.4 only. The impact of &ldquo;Stock-grind battles&rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players' average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players' performance in the same tier tanks.

    "content": "The Best Performing Tanks Highest Relative WR The graph shows the tanks with the highest Relative WR. That is the average of players' WR in a tank compared to their average WR at the tier (in all same tier tanks). Relative WR is a measure of the performance/strength of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 8.4 only. The impact of &ldquo;Stock-grind battles&rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players&rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier.

That is the average of players' WR in a tank compared to their average WR at the tier (in all same tier tanks). Relative WR is a measure of the performance/strength of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 8.4 only. The impact of &ldquo;Stock-grind battles&rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players' average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players' performance in the same tier tanks.

    "content": "The Best Performing Tanks Highest Relative WR The graph shows the tanks with the highest Relative WR. That is the average of players' WR in a tank compared to their average WR at the tier (in all same tier tanks). Relative WR is a measure of the performance/strength of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 8.4 only. The impact of &ldquo;Stock-grind battles&rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players&rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier.

That is the average of players' WR in a tank compared to their average WR at the tier (in all same tier tanks). Relative WR is a measure of the performance/strength of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 8.4 only. The impact of &ldquo;Stock-grind battles&rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players' average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players' performance in the same tier tanks.

    "content": "The Best Performing Tanks Highest Relative WR The graph shows the tanks with the highest Relative WR. That is the average of players' WR in a tank compared to their average WR at the tier (in all same tier tanks). Relative WR is a measure of the performance/strength of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 8.4 only. The impact of &ldquo;Stock-grind battles&rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players&rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier.

That is the average of players' WR in a tank compared to their average WR at the tier (in all same tier tanks). Relative WR is a measure of the performance/strength of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 8.4 only. The impact of &ldquo;Stock-grind battles&rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players' average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players' performance in the same tier tanks.

That is the average of players' WR in a tank compared to their average WR at the tier (in all same tier tanks). Relative WR is a measure of the performance/strength of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 8.4 only. The impact of &ldquo;Stock-grind battles&rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players&rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier.

That is the average of players' WR in a tank compared to their average WR at the tier (in all same tier tanks). Relative WR is a measure of the performance/strength of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 8.4 only. The impact of &ldquo;Stock-grind battles&rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players' average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players' performance in the same tier tanks.

    "content": "The Best Performing Tanks Highest Relative WR The graph shows the tanks with the highest Relative WR. That is the average of players' WR in a tank compared to their average WR at the tier (in all same tier tanks). Relative WR is a measure of the performance/strength of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 8.4 only. The impact of &ldquo;Stock-grind battles&rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players&rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier.

That is the average of players' WR in a tank compared to their average WR at the tier (in all same tier tanks). Relative WR is a measure of the performance/strength of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 8.4 only. The impact of &ldquo;Stock-grind battles&rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players' average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players' performance in the same tier tanks.

That is the average of players' WR in a tank compared to their average WR at the tier (in all same tier tanks). Relative WR is a measure of the performance/strength of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 8.4 only. The impact of &ldquo;Stock-grind battles&rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players&rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier.

That is the average of players' WR in a tank compared to their average WR at the tier (in all same tier tanks). Relative WR is a measure of the performance/strength of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 8.4 only. The impact of &ldquo;Stock-grind battles&rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players' average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players' performance in the same tier tanks.

    "content": "BlitzAnalysiz[] Welcome to BitzAnalysiz[], a site about in-depth analysis of World of Tanks Blitz game statistics.\nThe best performing tanks The best performing tanks tier-for-tier by Relative WR.\n\nLatest posts  2021-11-19 Update 8.4 final stats added  Final stats for update 8.4 have been added. In total, there were 105M battles by 403k players recorded in the database during the update 8.4. New (premium) tanks have entered the TOP20 best performing tanks list.\n 2021-10-24 Update 8.3 final stats added  Final stats for update 8.3 have been added. In total, there were 139M battles by 402k players recorded in the database during the update 8.3. The TOP20 best performing tanks list has undergone some big changes.\n 2021-09-18 Update 8.2 final stats added  Final stats for update 8.2 have been added. In total, there were 107M battles by 400k players recorded in the database during the update 8.2. The TOP20 best performing tanks list has not significant changes.\n 2021-08-29 Measuring tank performance, part II  Measuring and comparing tanks’ performance was my key motivation behind the decision to develop the BlitzAnalysiz[] site. In a Measuring tank performance, part I I showed how tanks’ player bases differ from each other and why thus Average WR is a poor measure for comparing tanks’ performance.\n 2021-08-22 Update 8.1 final stats added  Final stats for update 8.1 have been added. In total, there were 125M battles by 415k players recorded in the database during the update 8.1. This time there is a major change in the TOP20 best performing tanks - Annihilator did not even make to TOP20.\n 2021-07-17 Update 8.0 final stats added  Final stats for update 8.0 have been added. In total, there were 152M battles by 477k players recorded in the database during the update 8.0. Not much changes in the best performing tanks:\n 2021-06-11 Update 7.9 final stats added  Final stats for update 7.9 have been added. In total, there were 199M battles by 492k players recorded in the database during the update 7.9. It is getting boring the report the best performing tanks - the same ones keep topping the charts update after update in slightly different order: 1) Annihilator, 2) Object 252U, 3) T54E2, 4)T28 Concept and 5) Chimera.\n 2021-05-02 Update 7.8 final stats added  Final stats for update 7.8 have been added. In total, there were 169M battles by 483k players recorded in the database during the update 7.8. It is getting boring the report the best performing tanks - the same ones keep topping the charts update after update in slightly different order: 1) T28 Concept, 2) Object 252U, 3) Annihilator, 4) T54E2 and 5) Maus.\n 2021-03-26 Update 7.7 final stats added  Final stats for update 7.7 have been added. In total, there were 236M battles by 481k players recorded in the database during the update 7.7. Familiar &amp; well-armored tanks took the top spots in tank performance rankings: 1) Object 252U, 2) Annihilator and 3) T54E1.\n 2021-03-13 Vehicle Class (Im)Balance  I my view, the game became more boring after WG added Vehicle Class Matching rules into the MatchMaker (update 5.1). The exact vehicle class matching rules have been adjusted since, but basically the Vehicle Class Matching limits the number of Tank Destroyers and Light Tanks per team and makes sure there is only +/-1 tank difference between the teams across the vehicle classes.\n 2021-03-10 Update 7.7 preliminary stats added  Preliminary stats for update 7.7 have been added. In total, there has been 115M battles by 465k players recorded in the database during the update 7.7 so far. Please note, these are note all the WoT Blitz players, just those tracked by BlitzAnalysiz[].\n 2021-02-27 Update 7.6 final stats added  Final stats for update 7.6 have been added. Update 7.6 marked a great milestone for the site. BlitzAnalysiz[] is now tracking the performance of more than 1 million players!\n 2021-02-27 1 Million players  BlitzAnalysiz[] recently reach an impressive milestone: the site&rsquo;s database tracks now over 1 million players! That&rsquo;s is a big number so let&rsquo;s have a look on the player base. Career WR The chart below shows player&rsquo;s career WR over those 1M players.\n 2021-02-14 Update 7.6 preliminary stats added  Preliminary stats for update 7.6 have been added. In total, there has been 148M battles by 498k players recorded in the database during the update 7.6 so far. Please note, these are note all the WoT Blitz players, just those tracked by BlitzAnalysiz[].\n 2021-01-31 Update 7.5 final stats added  Final stats for update 7.5 have been added. In total, there were mind-blowing 452M battles by 610k players recorded in the database during the update 7.5. These are by far the largest numbers ever record at BlitzAnalysiz[].\n 2020-12-26 Update 7.5 preliminary stats added  Preliminary stats for update 7.5 have been added. In total, there were 151M battles by 481k players recorded in the database during the update 7.5 so far. Please note, these are note all the WoT Blitz players, just those tracked by BlitzAnalysiz[].\n 2020-12-11 Update 7.4 stats added  Final stats for update 7.4 have been added. In total, there were 208M battles by 491k players recorded in the database during the update 7.4 so far. Please note, these are note all the WoT Blitz players, just those tracked by BlitzAnalysiz[].\n 2020-12-03 The most OP tanks - ever  A fellow tanker asked a simple question of &ldquo;what is the most OP regular tank in Blitz of all time?&rdquo;. A fair question and something I would have not been able to guess.\n 2020-11-27 Update 7.4 preliminary stats added  Preliminary stats for update 7.4 have been added. In total, there were 105M battles by 419k players recorded in the database during the update 7.4 so far. Please note, these are note all the WoT Blitz players, just those tracked by BlitzAnalysiz[].\n 2020-11-13 Update 7.3 stats added  Stats for update 7.3 have been added. Total 230M battles by 484k players recorded in the database during the update 7.3. Please note, these are note all the WoT Blitz players, just those tracked by BlitzAnalysiz[].\n 2020-11-10 Rigged MM  Now there is evidence (for Mad &amp; Burning Games). Few weeks back I opened Discord to find out how someone had sent me tens of messages saying he thinks &ldquo;WG is rigging the Burning Games MM&rdquo;.\n 2020-10-11 Update 7.2 stats added  Stats for update 7.2 have been added. Record 205M battles by 456k players was recorded in the database. Please note, these are note all the WoT Blitz players, just those tracked by BlitzAnalysiz[].\n 2020-08-27 Update 7.1 stats added  Stats for update 7.1 have been added. Now tank pages are available to all tiers from update 7.0 onwards. Premium tanks (and especially the pricey container-only tanks) continue to dominate the tier VIII tank rankings.\n 2020-08-14 Tank-specific pages added  Big update! Tank-specific pages have been added to the site. The pages show detailed analysis of each tier V-X tank. One of the most interesting graphs is the Relative WR for different player skill-levels.\n 2020-07-16 Update 7.0 stats added  Added stats for update 7.0. Interestingly, the player base tracked played far less battles during the update compared to the previous update despite the update interval being very long due to the WG release schedule.\n 2020-06-17 Update 6.10 stats added  Stats for update 6.10 has been added to the site. How did the ATGM tanks actually perform? Did Sheridan deserve its nerf in 7.0? Was T92E1 still one of the best performing tier IX tanks?\n 2020-06-08 Measuring tank performance  Updated 2020-08-11 Over-Powered (OP) tanks are maybe the 2nd most popular topic on Blitz YouTube videos and online chats - right after &ldquo;the Matchmaker&rdquo;. I have long held the view that if a tank is &ldquo;OP&rdquo;, this has to be visible in statistics.\n 2020-05-16 Stats since update 6.0 added  I have been busy cleaning up the codebase and fixing tons of little issues. Here are main updates: Stats since update 6.0 I have added stats for updates since 6.0 to the site.\n 2020-05-07 BlitzAnalysiz.com launched  Hy!\nBlitzAnalysiz.com is a site about in-depth game statistics of Wargaming&rsquo;s World of Tanks Blitz.

That is the average of players' WR in a tank compared to their average WR at the tier (in all same tier tanks). Relative WR is a measure of the performance/strength of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 8.4 only. The impact of &ldquo;Stock-grind battles&rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players&rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players' performance in the same tier tanks.

Player WR denotes the tank&rsquo;s players' average WR across all the tanks during the update.\n  Details    Only battles in maxed-out tanks are taken into account. It is assumed that a tank is maxed out if it is a) premium tank or b) player has more than certain number of battles in it in the end of the update (tier dependent: Tier I: 0 battles, Tier X: 152 battles. Since the data is fetched once per update, the stats for just released new Tech-Tree tanks is lower than it should be since the battles players ground the tanks from stock are included in the average. On the other hand new high tier tanks are often ground first by more active and also better players that distorts the stats for those. Only tanks with more than 400 players are listed. This may filter out few upcoming tanks that are being tested.    Lowest Average Kills/Battle - Table   Show table   Average WR denotes average WR in a tank across all the players during the update.

That is the average of players' WR in a tank compared to their average WR at the tier (in all same tier tanks). Relative WR is a measure of the performance/strength of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 8.4 only. The graph shows averages over all the player skill-levels. Well-armored tanks tend to do better in the hands of less-skilled players and thus those tanks tend to have higher (average) Relative WR even in the hands of skilled players those could do relatively worse. The impact of &ldquo;Stock-grind battles&rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players&rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players' performance in the same tier tanks.

That is the average of players' WR in a tank compared to their average WR at the tier (in all same tier tanks). Relative WR is a measure of the performance/strength of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 8.4 only. The graph shows averages over all the player skill-levels. Well-armored tanks tend to do better in the hands of less-skilled players and thus those tanks tend to have higher (average) Relative WR even in the hands of skilled players those could do relatively worse. The impact of &ldquo;Stock-grind battles&rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players&rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players' performance in the same tier tanks.

That is the average of players' WR in a tank compared to their average WR at the tier (in all same tier tanks). Relative WR is a measure of the performance/strength of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 8.4 only. The graph shows averages over all the player skill-levels. Well-armored tanks tend to do better in the hands of less-skilled players and thus those tanks tend to have higher (average) Relative WR even in the hands of skilled players those could do relatively worse. The impact of &ldquo;Stock-grind battles&rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players&rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players' performance in the same tier tanks.

That is the average of players' WR in a tank compared to their average WR at the tier (in all same tier tanks). Relative WR is a measure of the performance/strength of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 8.4 only. The graph shows averages over all the player skill-levels. Well-armored tanks tend to do better in the hands of less-skilled players and thus those tanks tend to have higher (average) Relative WR even in the hands of skilled players those could do relatively worse. The impact of &ldquo;Stock-grind battles&rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players&rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players' performance in the same tier tanks.

Well-armored tanks tend to do better in the hands of less-skilled players and thus those tanks tend to have higher (average) Relative WR even in the hands of skilled players those could do relatively worse. The impact of &ldquo;Stock-grind battles&rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules).

Average WR is the players&rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier.

Well-armored tanks tend to do better in the hands of less-skilled players and thus those tanks tend to have higher (average) Relative WR even in the hands of skilled players those could do relatively worse. The impact of &ldquo;Stock-grind battles&rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players&rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players' performance in the same tier tanks.

That is the average of players' WR in a tank compared to their average WR at the tier (in all same tier tanks). Relative WR is a measure of the performance/strength of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 8.4 only. The graph shows averages over all the player skill-levels. Well-armored tanks tend to do better in the hands of less-skilled players and thus those tanks tend to have higher (average) Relative WR even in the hands of skilled players those could do relatively worse. The impact of &ldquo;Stock-grind battles&rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players&rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players' performance in the same tier tanks.

That is the average of players' WR in a tank compared to their average WR at the tier (in all same tier tanks). Relative WR is a measure of the performance/strength of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 8.4 only. The graph shows averages over all the player skill-levels. Well-armored tanks tend to do better in the hands of less-skilled players and thus those tanks tend to have higher (average) Relative WR even in the hands of skilled players those could do relatively worse. The impact of &ldquo;Stock-grind battles&rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players&rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players' performance in the same tier tanks.

That is the average of players' WR in a tank compared to their average WR at the tier (in all same tier tanks). Relative WR is a measure of the performance/strength of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 8.4 only. The graph shows averages over all the player skill-levels. Well-armored tanks tend to do better in the hands of less-skilled players and thus those tanks tend to have higher (average) Relative WR even in the hands of skilled players those could do relatively worse. The impact of &ldquo;Stock-grind battles&rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update.

Statistics for the Chinese server are not available via WG API.\nNumber of players This graphs shows players by region in the dataset who have played at least one game. Please note, this does not mean all the players per server, but just those who have been recorded in the BlitzAnalysiz database.\nWR Distribution This graph shows players' overall WR distribution during update 8.4 on different regions.\nThese graphs cannot be used to say anything about the skill-level differences between the servers. Instead, the graphs tell more about the player sampling per server. BlitzAnalysiz[] database has relatively more players from EU and NA (com) servers vs. RU and Asia servers. In all the servers the players sampled are on average more active and better than the true player average due to the way how the player account_ids are being harvested.\n Cumulative distribution function This graphs shows the same information than the previous in different format. The curve tells how large share of players (y-axis) had WR less than (x-axis) during update 8.4.\nPopularity of Tank Nations This graph shows the popularity of tank nations by region/server.\n"

That is the average of players' WR in a tank compared to their average WR at the tier (in all same tier tanks). Relative WR is a measure of the performance/strength of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 8.4 only. The graph shows averages over all the player skill-levels. Well-armored tanks tend to do better in the hands of less-skilled players and thus those tanks tend to have higher (average) Relative WR even in the hands of skilled players those could do relatively worse. The impact of &ldquo;Stock-grind battles&rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players&rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players' performance in the same tier tanks.

That is the average of players' WR in a tank compared to their average WR at the tier (in all same tier tanks). Relative WR is a measure of the performance/strength of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 8.4 only. The graph shows averages over all the player skill-levels. Well-armored tanks tend to do better in the hands of less-skilled players and thus those tanks tend to have higher (average) Relative WR even in the hands of skilled players those could do relatively worse. The impact of &ldquo;Stock-grind battles&rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players&rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players' performance in the same tier tanks.

That is the average of players' WR in a tank compared to their average WR at the tier (in all same tier tanks). Relative WR is a measure of the performance/strength of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 8.4 only. The graph shows averages over all the player skill-levels. Well-armored tanks tend to do better in the hands of less-skilled players and thus those tanks tend to have higher (average) Relative WR even in the hands of skilled players those could do relatively worse. The impact of &ldquo;Stock-grind battles&rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players&rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players' performance in the same tier tanks.

That is the average of players' WR in a tank compared to their average WR at the tier (in all same tier tanks). Relative WR is a measure of the performance/strength of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 8.4 only. The graph shows averages over all the player skill-levels. Well-armored tanks tend to do better in the hands of less-skilled players and thus those tanks tend to have higher (average) Relative WR even in the hands of skilled players those could do relatively worse. The impact of &ldquo;Stock-grind battles&rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players&rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players' performance in the same tier tanks.

In total, there were 105M battles by 403k players recorded in the database during the update 8.4. New (premium) tanks have entered the TOP20 best performing tanks list.\n 2021-10-24 Update 8.3 final stats added  Final stats for update 8.3 have been added. In total, there were 139M battles by 402k players recorded in the database during the update 8.3. The TOP20 best performing tanks list has undergone some big changes.\n 2021-09-18 Update 8.2 final stats added  Final stats for update 8.2 have been added. In total, there were 107M battles by 400k players recorded in the database during the update 8.2. The TOP20 best performing tanks list has not significant changes.\n 2021-08-29 Measuring tank performance, part II  Measuring and comparing tanks’ performance was my key motivation behind the decision to develop the BlitzAnalysiz[] site. In a Measuring tank performance, part I I showed how tanks’ player bases differ from each other and why thus Average WR is a poor measure for comparing tanks’ performance.\n 2021-08-22 Update 8.1 final stats added  Final stats for update 8.1 have been added. In total, there were 125M battles by 415k players recorded in the database during the update 8.1. This time there is a major change in the TOP20 best performing tanks - Annihilator did not even make to TOP20.\n 2021-07-17 Update 8.0 final stats added  Final stats for update 8.0 have been added. In total, there were 152M battles by 477k players recorded in the database during the update 8.0. Not much changes in the best performing tanks:\n 2021-06-11 Update 7.9 final stats added  Final stats for update 7.9 have been added. In total, there were 199M battles by 492k players recorded in the database during the update 7.9. It is getting boring the report the best performing tanks - the same ones keep topping the charts update after update in slightly different order: 1) Annihilator, 2) Object 252U, 3) T54E2, 4)T28 Concept and 5) Chimera.\n 2021-05-02 Update 7.8 final stats added  Final stats for update 7.8 have been added. In total, there were 169M battles by 483k players recorded in the database during the update 7.8. It is getting boring the report the best performing tanks - the same ones keep topping the charts update after update in slightly different order: 1) T28 Concept, 2) Object 252U, 3) Annihilator, 4) T54E2 and 5) Maus.\n 2021-03-26 Update 7.7 final stats added  Final stats for update 7.7 have been added. In total, there were 236M battles by 481k players recorded in the database during the update 7.7. Familiar &amp; well-armored tanks took the top spots in tank performance rankings: 1) Object 252U, 2) Annihilator and 3) T54E1.\n 2021-03-13 Vehicle Class (Im)Balance  I my view, the game became more boring after WG added Vehicle Class Matching rules into the MatchMaker (update 5.1). The exact vehicle class matching rules have been adjusted since, but basically the Vehicle Class Matching limits the number of Tank Destroyers and Light Tanks per team and makes sure there is only +/-1 tank difference between the teams across the vehicle classes.\n 2021-03-10 Update 7.7 preliminary stats added  Preliminary stats for update 7.7 have been added. In total, there has been 115M battles by 465k players recorded in the database during the update 7.7 so far. Please note, these are note all the WoT Blitz players, just those tracked by BlitzAnalysiz[].\n 2021-02-27 Update 7.6 final stats added  Final stats for update 7.6 have been added. Update 7.6 marked a great milestone for the site. BlitzAnalysiz[] is now tracking the performance of more than 1 million players!\n 2021-02-27 1 Million players  BlitzAnalysiz[] recently reach an impressive milestone: the site&rsquo;s database tracks now over 1 million players! That&rsquo;s is a big number so let&rsquo;s have a look on the player base. Career WR The chart below shows player&rsquo;s career WR over those 1M players.\n 2021-02-14 Update 7.6 preliminary stats added  Preliminary stats for update 7.6 have been added. In total, there has been 148M battles by 498k players recorded in the database during the update 7.6 so far. Please note, these are note all the WoT Blitz players, just those tracked by BlitzAnalysiz[].\n 2021-01-31 Update 7.5 final stats added  Final stats for update 7.5 have been added. In total, there were mind-blowing 452M battles by 610k players recorded in the database during the update 7.5. These are by far the largest numbers ever record at BlitzAnalysiz[].\n 2020-12-26 Update 7.5 preliminary stats added  Preliminary stats for update 7.5 have been added. In total, there were 151M battles by 481k players recorded in the database during the update 7.5 so far. Please note, these are note all the WoT Blitz players, just those tracked by BlitzAnalysiz[].\n 2020-12-11 Update 7.4 stats added  Final stats for update 7.4 have been added. In total, there were 208M battles by 491k players recorded in the database during the update 7.4 so far. Please note, these are note all the WoT Blitz players, just those tracked by BlitzAnalysiz[].\n 2020-12-03 The most OP tanks - ever  A fellow tanker asked a simple question of &ldquo;what is the most OP regular tank in Blitz of all time?&rdquo;. A fair question and something I would have not been able to guess.\n 2020-11-27 Update 7.4 preliminary stats added  Preliminary stats for update 7.4 have been added. In total, there were 105M battles by 419k players recorded in the database during the update 7.4 so far. Please note, these are note all the WoT Blitz players, just those tracked by BlitzAnalysiz[].\n 2020-11-13 Update 7.3 stats added  Stats for update 7.3 have been added. Total 230M battles by 484k players recorded in the database during the update 7.3. Please note, these are note all the WoT Blitz players, just those tracked by BlitzAnalysiz[].\n 2020-11-10 Rigged MM  Now there is evidence (for Mad &amp; Burning Games). Few weeks back I opened Discord to find out how someone had sent me tens of messages saying he thinks &ldquo;WG is rigging the Burning Games MM&rdquo;.\n 2020-10-11 Update 7.2 stats added  Stats for update 7.2 have been added. Record 205M battles by 456k players was recorded in the database. Please note, these are note all the WoT Blitz players, just those tracked by BlitzAnalysiz[].\n 2020-08-27 Update 7.1 stats added  Stats for update 7.1 have been added. Now tank pages are available to all tiers from update 7.0 onwards. Premium tanks (and especially the pricey container-only tanks) continue to dominate the tier VIII tank rankings.\n 2020-08-14 Tank-specific pages added  Big update! Tank-specific pages have been added to the site. The pages show detailed analysis of each tier V-X tank. One of the most interesting graphs is the Relative WR for different player skill-levels.\n 2020-07-16 Update 7.0 stats added  Added stats for update 7.0. Interestingly, the player base tracked played far less battles during the update compared to the previous update despite the update interval being very long due to the WG release schedule.\n 2020-06-17 Update 6.10 stats added  Stats for update 6.10 has been added to the site. How did the ATGM tanks actually perform? Did Sheridan deserve its nerf in 7.0? Was T92E1 still one of the best performing tier IX tanks?\n 2020-06-08 Measuring tank performance  Updated 2020-08-11 Over-Powered (OP) tanks are maybe the 2nd most popular topic on Blitz YouTube videos and online chats - right after &ldquo;the Matchmaker&rdquo;. I have long held the view that if a tank is &ldquo;OP&rdquo;, this has to be visible in statistics.\n 2020-05-16 Stats since update 6.0 added  I have been busy cleaning up the codebase and fixing tons of little issues. Here are main updates: Stats since update 6.0 I have added stats for updates since 6.0 to the site.\n 2020-05-07 BlitzAnalysiz.com launched  Hy!\nBlitzAnalysiz.com is a site about in-depth game statistics of Wargaming&rsquo;s World of Tanks Blitz. You won&rsquo;t find individial player statistics here - for those, please check awesome Blitzstars.com. Instead, the the site is about analysis of the player population and tank performance statistics.\n "

Added clarification of what &ldquo;WR&rdquo; is on player skill-level charts (=player WR at the tier in question).  2021-07-17  Added final stats for update 8.0. Added Relative WR stats for 55-65% and +65% player segments separately  2021-06-11  Added final stats for update 7.9.  2021-05-02  Added final stats for update 7.8.  2021-05-02  Added preliminary stats for update 7.8.  2021-03-26  Added preliminary stats for update 7.7.  2021-02-14  Added preliminary stats for update 7.6.  2021-02-01  Added relative WR stats by skill-level for tank type and premium tank pages.  2021-01-31  Added final stats for update 7.5. New Relative WR by player skill-level (WR at tier) added. New code to manage larger stats not fitting into RAM (32GB).  2020-12-26  Added preliminary stats for update 7.5. Added links to tank-pages into stats tables  2020-12-11  Added final stats for update 7.4.  2020-12-03  New Blog article about the most OP tanks of all time.  2020-11-27  Added preliminary stats for update 7.4. I have develop scripts to clean up the database so I can in the future release preliminary stats before the next update.  2020-11-13  Added full stats for update 7.3. Just after I was proud to release preliminary stats for the first time, WG announced a new update. So the preliminary stats were served total three days. In the future I plan to release preliminary stats 2 weeks after an update.  2020-11-10  Added preliminary stats for update 7.3. I have develop scripts to clean up the database so I can in the future release preliminary stats before the next update. New blog article about MM Rigging (in Mad/Burning Games).  2020-10-10  Stats for update 7.2 are out. I finally managed to fix the parallel processing error (it was multi-threading, not shared memory issue). Debugging parallel code is PIA.  2020-08-27  Stats for 7.1 are finally out. After adding the tank-pages the site build time has grown 10x and I have been looking for parallel processing to speed up the work. But I have ran into weird issues likely related to shared memory limits causing the parallel build script to fail.  2020-08-16  Added pages for premium tanks per tier (V-X). Added tank listing in the beginning of the tank type pages.  2020-08-14  New tank-specific pages with lot of detailed information about each tank in comparison to the same tier/type tanks. Hit Rate and average kills charts added to Tanks, Tanks per tier, Tanks of Type and Tank  2020-08-08  Histograms are now pretty &amp; colored and have mean/median values. Career stats are now calculated based on true career stats including players who did not play and tanks that were not played during the update. New graphs:  WR vs. battles played during the upgrade Current WR vs. Career Battles. I think this is what you asked, Mjr_Eazy@EU ;-) Career WR vs. Career Battles. This one is a bonus. Most popular tanks through the history of the game. Most played tanks through the history of the game. Most popular nations by Region/Server   New fancy parallel build system that cut down the built time 70%. It took insane amount of debugging. Reworking the code the create reasonable axis breaks and labels. This little &ldquo;fix&rdquo; took lot of time, enjoy :-D Updated home page layout. Images are now in SVG format instead of PNG. In case there are browser compatibility issues, please let me know.  2020-07-22  Career stats have been updated and calculated by all the cumulative stats in the database, not just stats from players who played during the update. The build system is 3x slower again thanks to far larger data set. Added graphs for Career/current WR vs. battles played.  2020-07-18  New parallel building setup. 3x faster than before. Image format changed from PNG to SVG. Yes the font is dead-ugly, will update it later New graphs: Player current WR vs. Career battles played and Player career WR vs. Career battles played  2020-07-16  Stats added for Update 7.0. New pages for each tank type per tier have been added. These pages list all the tanks in the tier for each tank type.  2020-06-17  Stats added for update 6.10 Also fixed a bug in the code (function params in wrong order..) that likely caused too many tank stats being filtered out.  2020-06-08  Blog post about measuring tank performance Changes to stats filtering and Relative WR algo  Stats filtering unified to eliminate stock-grind tanks' impact on tank performance stats (Averate WR, Relative WR, Average damage, etc.). Earlier new tanks got impacted by the stock-grind battles being taken into account. The number of required battle is a compromise based on average tank research XP divided by players' average XP at the tier and divided by 1.5^2. This can be intepreted as playing with 50% WR and only the first 2x XP victories plus XP boosters. Making the filter too aggressive seriously limits the available data, therefore the compromise.\nRequired number of battles per tier\n   1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10     0 1 4 9 18 34 51 86 139 152    Relative WR formula revised to do the comparison to average of all the same tier tanks, including the tank itself. This seems to provide more sensible results than the earlier using other same tier tanks as the comparison point. Honestly speaking, I do not know why. The first algorithm seemed clever, but the detailed graphs showed it failed somehow.\nThe first Relative WR incarnation also had an error that while it filtered out stock-grind tanks, it included those in the calculation of the comparison WR (i.e. average WR of other same tier tanks). This caused RElative WR to be higher for all the tanks than it actually was.\n2020-06-08 New blog post: Measuring tank performance 2020-05-16 Stats since update 6.0 added Stats since Update 6.0 added. Graphs are also now based on plot templates to unify look&rsquo;n' feel.\n2020-05-07 BlitzAnalysiz.com launched "

    "content": "1. Where is the data from All the data has been collected from Wargaming API and processed with R/RStudio.\n2. Are your numbers correct? Is there bias in the numbers? The statistics have been calculated from a data set with very high number of players (700,000+) and battles (in total 6bn+). That is maybe 4 times the users Blitzstars.com has. However, there is still sampling bias as there is any Blitz stats tracker site. This is evidenced by the overall WR distribution and the share of all wins out of all the battles in the database being above 50%. This is a topic worth of a longer post - stay tuned.\n3. Why did you make the site? Out of pure interest into analyzing Blitz game statistics and to learn data analysis and R.\n4. What is &ldquo;Relative WR&rdquo;? Relative WR the average of player WR in a tank minus their Average WR in all the same tier tanks. If the tank is perfectly balanced, its Relative WR is 0 %. Large positive Relative WR indicates the tank is &ldquo;very good&rdquo; (read &ldquo;OP&rdquo;). Negative Relative WR indicate the tank performce worse than other same tier tanks. Relative WR is one of the better (if not the best) best measures for tank performance since it takes the skill differences in tanks' playerbases into account, IMHO.\n  Relative WR R code   rWR = Relative WR\n# calculate players WR at a tier (WR.tier) for all the _maxed-out_ tanks stats[DT_filter_tank_is_maxed2(all.battles.new, tier, is_premium), WR.tier := sum(all.wins)/sum(all.battles), by=.(account_id, tier)]; # Count the number of maxed out tanks per player per tier stats[DT_filter_tank_is_maxed2(all.battles.new, tier, is_premium), tanks.tier := .N, by=.(account_id, tier)]; # Calculate relative WR for players with 2 or more maxed-out tanks at the tier.  # Relative WR is calculated only maxed-out tanks with enough battles during the update  stats[ (tanks.tier &gt; 1) &amp; DT_filter_battles_tank(all.battles, tier), rWR := WR - WR.tier]; The bit cryptic syntax is R&rsquo;s data.table - one of the fastest software packages for data analysis.\n  5. Is BlitzAnalysiz[]' Relative WR different from Blitzstars' one? Yes, a bit. At the moment Blitzstars.com calculate the Relative WR as WR difference to the players' average WR over all their tanks. BlitzAnalysiz[] considers only the other same tier tanks. The real differences are likely rather small.\n6. Why is the number of players of a tank different in different tables? Performance related graphs/tables are being calculated only of tanks that:\n Are maxed-out based on a tier-dependent estimate it takes to max out a tank (tier V: 18, tier X: 152 battles). Premium tanks do not have this requirement The player has enough battles (10-20) in the tank during the update. The requirement depends on the tier. The player is out from sub-5k MM queue existing in EU and RU servers (min 5000 battles). This requirement is not applied to the Asia or North America servers.  In addition, Relative WR charts require a player to have:\n Enough battles in at least two maxed out tanks at a tier  Graphs/tables showing tank popularity or battles played do not filter battles.\n7.

    "content": "Final stats for update 8.4 have been added.\n In total, there were 105M battles by 403k players recorded in the database during the update 8.4.  New (premium) tanks have entered the TOP20 best performing tanks list.\n  Thanks to the recent promotion, Somua SM has entered the battlefield in numbers and taken the 3rd spot. High burst damage combined with ultra-strong turret, good gun depression and decent mobility - what could go wrong?\n  The usual suspects T28 Concept and Object 252U have taken the the top spots again.\n  Rather unpopular AT 15A has dropped to 17th. I think its low player count make its relative WR stats more unreliable with high update-to-update variation.\n  Dead-ugly fake-tank Dreadnought (a buffed fantasy-copy of Churchill Gun Carrier aka Coffin on Tracks) was 4th.\n  IS-7 received a nice buff during &ldquo;PBR remodeling&quot;and it is really good now and actually the best performing Tech-Tree tank (8th).\n  \nPolish heavy tanks Update 8.4 introduced Polish heavy tanks. I have reached tier IX with those and I think all the tanks so far are fine tanks. Good armor, good mobility, OK gun-depression and good alpha. However, the stats of the Polish heavies look &ldquo;meh&rdquo; at the best. However, usually the first update&rsquo;s stats underestimate a bit the performance of new tank lines. This might be due to many players still grinding the tanks with stock modules and below-100% crews. I try to take the grind-time into consideration, but there is no certain way to filter out non-maxed out tanks. I expect the stats to improve a bit in next update.\nTier VI 40TP Habicha The tier VI 40TP Habicha was a nice tank in my view, but based on stats it was the 3rd worst performing tier VI heavy tank. I played only 17 battles with it (boosters, yeah) and got 70% WR. I have too few battles to really say anything of my own performance with it, but it felt OK - or I got carried :-)\n\nTier VII 45TP Habicha The tier VII 45TP Habicha was also a nice tank in my view, but based on stats it was the 2nd worst performing tier VII heavy tank. I played 52 battles with it and did OK, although I felt fighting with windmills (teams) and reached only 61% WR.\n\nTier VIII 53TP Markowskiego The tier VIII 53TP Markowskiego was again a really nice tank in my view, but based on stats it is just an average performer among tier VIII heavy tanks. I played 82 battles with it and reached 64% WR with it that is pretty average for me.\n\nTier IX 50TP Tyszkiewicza The tier IX 50TP Tyszkiewicza is another good tank in my view, but based on stats it is an average performer among tier IX heavy tanks. I have played so far 110 battles with it and standing at 60% WR with it. The Gods of MM are asking more sacrifices from my wallet.\n\nTier X 60TP Lewandowskiego I have not played the tier X 60TP Lewandowskiego yet, but it does not seem to be so fearsome enemy on the battlefield. Yes, it has a great turret, but I have felt it is pretty balanced. However, based on stats it seems to be a below-average performer among tier X heavy tanks.\n\nLet&rsquo;s see how the update 8.5 stats turn out once those are out. It is hard for me to believe this line is performing so poorly since I think the tanks are all fine.\nThat&rsquo;s all this time\n"

Annihilator was nerfed via MM in update 8.1 and it has since dropped from the list. It is still insanely powerful tank, but meets always another Anni in the red team so easy farming days in completely broken tank are over. Crocodile&rsquo;s tears from me, boys.\n  Dreadnought - the new event tank based on Churchill Gun Carrier - seems to perform great and it took the Top 5 spot right away.\n  Otherwise the list is full of the typical premium tanks like T28 Concept, Object 252U and AT 15A that took the 3rd spot. The AT 15A is played by quite small player population so that might create bias to the results. It might also be that the armor highlighting change in update 8.1 has played to benefit well armored tanks since pens now have a change to pen even the armor is shown red.\n  Emil I is the best performing Tech tree tank at 4th place, but also the only Tech tree tank in Top 10. Talk about pay-to-win.\n  \n Chimera has dropped surprisingly low despite it has not received any nerfs. I am not certain why this has happened. This could be due to sensitivity of the Relative WR method itself or due changes of the tanks played at tier VIII introducing counter-forces to it. Good ideas are welcome!  Annihilator is still a great tank &hellip; Even it does not win much.\n Just to highlight how has the &ldquo;MM-nerf&rdquo; impacted on the Annihilator. It is now the 3rd worst performing Tier VII heavy tank in terms of Relative WR.  \n But the Annihilator is still dealing disproportionate amount of damage and havoc at the battlefield.  \n Well, Halloween is coming. Sealclubbers, get your wallets ready :-)  "

Instead, Object 252U took the lead and T28 Concept and T54E2 took the 2nd and 3rd spots respectively.\n  \nAnnihilator&rsquo;s &ldquo;nerf&rdquo;  Wait, was Annihilator secretly nerfed in update 8.1? Yes and no. While its stats were not touched, WG did nerf Anni through MM. Ever since update 8.1, battles have had equal number of Annihilators on both the sides. While Annihilators still reap havoc on the battlefields, the red teams have had equal number of those ridiculously OP tanks. This is WG&rsquo;s way of secretly nerfing a tank that according to their own words &ldquo;doesn&rsquo;t affect balance system so much&rdquo;&hellip;  \n The above image is courtesy of gallabru@EU who has analyzed the replays submitted to WoTinspector.com. There is nothing uncertain about this secret MM rule for the Annihilator, but WG has not officially communicated this change. Maybe WG is preparing players for the next ultra-OP Halloween tank?  Other notable changes  The tier X M-VI-Yoh has improved its performance still and got into tier X TOP10. Maybe players have learned to use the small 3-shot gun that has crazy DPM. The dual-shot gun is so fun, but it lacks the DPM to survive end-games.  \n The new tier VIII premium tank Somua SM has performed very well and why not: a tank with high burst damage, great turret armor, gun depression and decent mobility rarely struggles on on the battlefield.  \n It should be noted though that in addition for the Somua SM being very good tank (especially for the less-skilled payers), it has been played by very good players so far (tier VIII WR +6% vs. the average).  \n The other new tier VIII premium tank Škoda T 27 did not perform that well and ended up being 6th worst performing tier VIII medium tank.  \n Sturer Emil got (over)buffed in update 8.1, but it did not impact that much on its stats. It seems the tank is still too hard to play for most of the players (no armor, no turret). I personally felt the engine-buff was too much and the tank lost its sluggish characteristics and became more of an arcade version of itself. I wish WG would partially reverse its engine buff :-)  \n"

    "content": "Measuring and comparing tanks’ performance was my key motivation behind the decision to develop the BlitzAnalysiz[] site. In a Measuring tank performance, part I I showed how tanks’ player bases differ from each other and why thus Average WR is a poor measure for comparing tanks’ performance. Have a look at the differences among the Tiger II and Somua SM players' WR at tier VIII. There is over 8% difference between the tanks' players average WR at tier VIII. That is huge difference and therefore it&rsquo;s clear the average WR of Somua SM is far higher than that of Tiger II.\nBut does that tell the Somua SM is a better thank than Tiger II? You can&rsquo;t tell based on average WR. You need to look the tank&rsquo;s Relative WR to compare the tanks' performance, not just the tanks' players' performance.\nRelative WR has its issues But while Relative WR is a very good and (semi)understandable measure, but it has few issues in practice.\nShortage of data To keep the stats relevant, the analysis should be run for a reasonably short period (e.g. for each update), but only small share of players play enough battles in maxed-out tanks during each update. Most of the time players are grinding new tanks. The histogram of tier VIII players shows how 33% of players do not play a single game in a maxed out tank (or a premium tank) and how almost 80% of players do not play enough battles (20) in a maxed-out tank during an update to get included into Relative WR calculations. In other words, only 20% of the players get included into Relative WR calculations (i.e. have enough battles in at least one maxed-out tank and have enough battles at the same tier in maxed out-tanks). This really is not an issue for more popular tanks, but it impacts on the accuracy of Relative WR for less-played tanks.\nDifferent comparison points Since players play enough battles with only very few maxed-out tanks during an update, the comparison points for different players is not the same. One could think that with enough data the differences will level, but not. For example just 2.3% of Sturer Emil players played also Annihilator enough for their Annihilator games to count into Relative WR calculations. For Smasher players the percentage was 17%.\nIt seems players who play an OP tank (that often premiums) are more likely to play also other OP tanks. This is distorting Relative WR as a measure since the comparison point for those players is already elevated. And I don&rsquo;t blame the players - it takes certain attitude to play underdog tanks for fun.\nPlayer base composition Different tanks are played by different player populations. While the Relative WR is more resistant to the player base skill differences than average WR, it is not immune to those. The differences become meaningful with tanks with specially high skill-floor or low skill-ceiling. These tanks perform relatively worse (or better) with low-skilled (and vice versa for the highly-skilled) players. Light tanks are generally tanks with high skill-floor. It takes considerable skill to even carry one’s own weight in light tanks. As you can see from the Relative WR by WR at the tier plot below, less-skilled players underperform in Spähpanzer SP I C, but very good players overperform their personal tier VII average.\nA contrary effect can be seen in tanks with a low skill-ceiling. These are tanks which perform relatively worse in the hands of very good players. These are often well-armored, but slow tanks. The armor keeps poor players alive, but the poor mobility hinders good players from seizing opportunities they could with other more mobile tanks. VK 168.01 (P) is one example of tanks with low skill-ceiling. It does not mean that good players have lower WR in it than bad players, but it means good players have (on average) lower WR in the VK 168.01 (P) than in their other same tier tanks.\nIt is easy to see how the player population can impact significantly to the tanks (average) Relative WR if tank&rsquo;s Relative WR varies greatly by player skill-level. If, for example, VK 168.01 (P) was played mostly by below-average players, its (average) Relative WR would be high, but if it were mostly played by very good players, its (average) Relative WR would be low and actually negative (i.e. below average).\nConclusion Despite the issues discussed above Relative WR is a good tank performance measure. It should be noted that the last issue - the impact of player population - is a sampling issue and not an issue of the Relative WR per se. Player population impacts on every performance measure.\nThe distortions caused by sampling errors are common in all statistical studies and surveys. The common way to counter sampling issues and in case of tank stats the differences in player base composition is the use of stratified sampling. The issues of availability of data and different comparison points are more fundamental and directly related to the Relative WR methodology.\nBut how to tackle the first two issues? Well, I would have not written this post if I didn&rsquo;t have something in mind. Stay tuned ;-)\n"

    "content": "Big update! Tank-specific pages have been added to the site. The pages show detailed analysis of each tier V-X tank. One of the most interesting graphs is the Relative WR for different player skill-levels. WR at the tier is used as a measure for players' skill. It tells how well the tank is performing for different skill-level players relative to the other players' other same tier tanks.\nIf the Relative WR is high for players with low WR at the tier, it means the tank is easy to play and less-skilled players do in average better in it than other same tier tanks. These are usually well-armored tanks with high-alpha guns.\n\nIf the relative WR is negative for players with low WR at the tier, but high for players with high WR at the tier, it means the tank is difficult to play, but can perform well in the hands of a good player. These are often tanks that require high-level of tactical skills and gameplay. It might be frustrating for less-skilled players to play these tanks.\n\nStats levels vs. WR in a tank Tank pages also have graphs showing input-stat levels (average damage, average kills, spot rate, etc.) for different WR levels. The bars show 20-80% of the players within the WR bucket (20% have lower stats and 20% have higher stats with the same WR).\n\nX/Y Stats vs. WR in a tank Finally, there are contour-plots of two input-stats vs. WR. These graphs show what combination of stats are require in average to reach certain WR with a tank.\n\nPlease note that the plotting library tries to make the contour lines convex and therefore certain graphs have odd behaviors on the edges.\n"

    "content": "Now there is evidence (for Mad &amp; Burning Games).\nFew weeks back I opened Discord to find out how someone had sent me tens of messages saying he thinks &ldquo;WG is rigging the Burning Games MM&rdquo;. I did not know him, and at first I put him into the same category with other countless players accusing &ldquo;the MM is rigged&rdquo; - usually without providing any proper evidence.\nBut this guys was not spamming me with post-battle screenshots, but with screenshots of WoTBot replay analysis showing consistent and large differences between the allied and enemy team average WR. The player said the battles were all consecutive battles and he had posted more than 100 to replays.WoTinspector.com. Wow, &ldquo;this is different&rdquo;, I thought and got immediately interested. No one of the &ldquo;MM whiners&rdquo; had ever wanted to provide proper data in the form of consecutive &amp; non-cherry-picked replays. I fetched the replays and ran the first analysis with blitz-tools/analyse_wotb_replays.py script:\nTOTAL_______________ Battles WR DPB Player WR Allies WR Enemies WR Total : 134 : 38.1% : 1603 : 67% : 49.82% : 51.87% Player Histograms______ Win rate | Allies | Enemies | TOTAL 0% - 35% | 0 ( 0.0%) | 0 ( 0.0%) | 0 ( 0.0%) 35% - 40% | 6 ( 0.7%) | 4 ( 0.4%) | 10 ( 0.6%) 40% - 45% | 127 (15.8%) | 91 ( 9.7%) | 218 (12.5%) 45% - 48% | 186 (23.1%) | 154 (16.4%) | 340 (19.5%) 48% - 50% | 132 (16.4%) | 148 (15.8%) | 280 (16.1%) 50% - 52% | 117 (14.6%) | 139 (14.8%) | 256 (14.7%) 52% - 55% | 115 (14.3%) | 167 (17.8%) | 282 (16.2%) 55% - 60% | 81 (10.1%) | 128 (13.6%) | 209 (12.0%) 60% - 65% | 32 ( 4.0%) | 70 ( 7.5%) | 102 ( 5.9%) 65% - 70% | 6 ( 0.7%) | 32 ( 3.4%) | 38 ( 2.2%) 70% - | 2 ( 0.2%) | 5 ( 0.5%) | 7 ( 0.4%) The analysis showed massive 2% difference between the allied and enemy teams' average WRs. I had never seen anything close to such a massive difference. The distribution of player WR in the allied/enemy teams also showed how the enemy teams got constantly better players (see the graph below). The player was a capable 67% WR (career) player and yet he managed to win only 38.1% of his battles. A bad run? Maybe, but I knew such a large difference in teams average WR was extremely rare.\nI then analyzed the replays for any cherry-picking and it was clear that he was speaking the truth. The replays seemed to be from consecutive battles played over few days.\nI then published my findings on EU, NA, Asia and RU forums and started encouraging players to submit replays to WoTinspector.com. Burning Games were about to end, but I had a suspicion that the very same MM rigging would continue in Mad Games.\nMad Games &hellip; And it did. After the Mad Games ended, there were 1037 Mad Games replays submitted to WoTinspector.com. The results show how good players were clearly given stronger enemy teams, even the MM should have chosen the players randomly. For 65%+ WR players there was more than 2% difference between the allied/enemy teams' average WR, and for 55-65% WR there was more than 1% average difference. The stronger-than-normal enemies caused the very good players to lose more than half of their battles. There was only one replay by a 35-45% WR player, but that replay was mirroring the good players destiny. He got carried by his team having nearly 2% average WR advantage.\nMad Games replay analysis ./analyze_wotb_replays.py --mode team --extra total player_wins --only --filters '{ &quot;data.summary.battle_start_timestamp&quot;: { &quot;$gte&quot;: 1603526400} , &quot;data.summary.room_type&quot;: 8 }' db: Fetching player stats |████████████████████████████████| 12050/12050 100% ETA 0 h 0 mins TOTAL_______________ Battles % Battles WR Player WR Allies WR Enemies WR Total 1037 : 100% : 51.3% : 61.45% : 50.56% : 51.85% Player WR___________ Battles % Battles WR Player WR Allies WR Enemies WR 35 - 45% 1 : 0% : 100.0% : 43.80% : 54.23% : 52.66% 45 - 50% 28 : 3% : 78.6% : 47.41% : 50.65% : 50.52% 50 - 55% 146 : 14% : 55.5% : 52.30% : 51.63% : 51.71% 55 - 65% 508 : 49% : 49.6% : 60.10% : 50.42% : 51.54% 65 - % 354 : 34% : 49.7% : 68.33% : 50.31% : 52.45% And while 2% average WR difference may seem small, let&rsquo;s remember that this is a difference between the teams' averages. In total there is 7 * 2% = 14% total WR point difference between the team equivalent of the enemy team having one extra unicum/super unicum against an average player (e.g. 64% player vs. a 50% player in the allied team). When plotting a histogram of allied &amp; enemy teams' average WR, it becomes dead-obvious how the MM was not even trying to be random, but was clearly rigged against good players (WR 55%+).\nFAQ Are these some cherry-picked replays? Very unlikely. Most of these (926 out of 1037) were from players who submitted at least 10 replays, therefore undermining the claim that the replays themselves were somehow cherry-picked extraordinary games.\nCould this be just &ldquo;random variation&rdquo; Beyond any reasonable doubt, no. Student&rsquo;s t-test is a way to test whether two samples come from the same random (normal) distribution (it was originally developed to monitor the consistency of Guinness beer so it must be working). A paired t-test gave extremely small p-value (probability) of 2.2e-16 for (a null hypothesis that) the two samples (allied &amp; enemy team average WRs) are coming from the same random distribution. The probability of 2.2e-16 is extremely low (smaller than winning the main prize in Eurojack pot twice in a row).\nIs the player herself counted in? Please note that the player submitting the replays has not been counted to the allied teams because she has not been selected randomly since we have selected her replay into the data set. When the player itself was added back to the allied team, the average WR difference between the teams for WR 55%+ players changed from -1.54% to +0.3% for the allied team.\nWhat about the impact of platoons? I did experiment with removing platoons from both the side from the data set, but it did not have any meaningful impact to the results.\nThis data is therefore a strong evidence that WG has been applying &ldquo;Skill-Based MatchMaking&rdquo; (aka &ldquo;Rigged the MM&rdquo;) for the special game modes (Burning &amp; Mad Games).\nCan skill-based MM work? I actually do not know. I am 100% certain the skill-based MM WG applied to the Burning &amp; Mad Games will never work (i.e. balancing teams' WR per battle). It will just make any decent player to suffer from inferior teams.\nAn MM that splits players into separate leagues and then applies random MM within the league could work, but I doubt Blitz has enough players for such an MM to result decent queuing times. And if the skill-gaps between the leagues are too large, it will lead other types of problems: players whose skill were just above the lower bar of the league would lose lot more than they would do in normal random battles without leagues. There are not easy answers here. It is not possible for everyone to win a lot in PVP games.\nRegular Battles are NOT rigged It is important to understand that so far there has not been any proof of WG rigging MM in Regular Battles. Instead, the data is clearly supporting the notion that Regular Battles are based on random MM within the MM rules (tier/vehicle class matching):\n./analyze_wotb_replays.py --mode team --extra total player_wins mastery_badge battle_i --only --filters '{ &quot;$and&quot; : [ {&quot;data.summary.battle_start_timestamp&quot;: { &quot;$gte&quot;: 1602853200}}, {&quot;data.summary.battle_start_timestamp&quot;: { &quot;$lt&quot; : 1604106000}} ] , &quot;data.summary.room_type&quot;: 1 }' --min 10 db: Fetching player stats |████████████████████████████████| 6850/6862 99% ETA 0 h 0 mins TOTAL_______________ Battles % Battles WR Player WR Allies WR Enemies WR Total 550 : 100% : 66.9% : 59.28% : 50.15% : 50.07% Battle Medal________ Battles % Battles WR Player WR Allies WR Enemies WR - 247 : 45% : 35.2% : 58.40% : 50.20% : 50.61% 3rd Class 121 : 22% : 93.4% : 58.70% : 51.04% : 49.64% 2nd Class 90 : 16% : 93.3% : 59.15% : 50.06% : 49.60% 1st Class 40 : 7% : 90.0% : 59.34% : 49.37% : 49.84% Mastery 52 : 9% : 92.3% : 64.94% : 48.59% : 49.52% Player WR___________ Battles % Battles WR Player WR Allies WR Enemies WR 45 - 50% 24 : 4% : 79.2% : 46.17% : 49.88% : 49.55% 50 - 55% 99 : 18% : 55.6% : 52.28% : 49.79% : 49.39% 55 - 65% 342 : 62% : 66.7% : 59.70% : 50.31% : 50.28% 65 - % 85 : 15% : 77.6% : 69.43% : 50.01% : 50.18% The differences between allied/enemy teams average WR are negligible even the data set is far smaller (means over a smaller data set can have vary more than larger data sets). Many of the replays posted to WoTinspector.com are special games (Masteries, big damage, ultra-noob teams). Therefore, I have selected here only replays from players who have submitted at least 10 replays during sample period (Regular battles played during the Mad Games). Selecting all the replays would not change the conclusion though that Regular Battles MM is not rigged.\nWhat are WG&rsquo;s plans for MM? I think this is the very first proper evidence of rigged &hellip; err&hellip; skill-based MM in Blitz. But it has been applied only to Mad &amp; Burning Game modes so far. The big question is what is WG&rsquo;s plan with Skill-Based MM going forward? It is bit concerning that WG recently renamed &ldquo;Random Battles&rdquo; to &ldquo;Regular Battles&rdquo;. And it could be just coincidence, that and WG (RibbleStribe?) was talking about &ldquo;Tweaking MM&rdquo; in a recent Blitz Youtube stream few months back.\nAll this raises concerns that WG could be considering implementing Skill-Based MM in Regular Battles. WG could also be applying the Skill-Based MM only to the not-so-serious &ldquo;special&rdquo; modes, but until WG clearly states its intentions, we simply do not know.\nBut thanks to replays.WoTinspector.com and blitz-tools/analyse_wotb_replays tool, we now have means to detect any (consistent) MM rigging WG is applying. We do not have to guess and speculate any more, but we have tools to know.\nI am personally actually all fine with WG to applying skill-based MM to the &ldquo;non-serious&rdquo; game modes likes Mad Games or Burning Games. I do not play those and I do not think one can take those seriously. But I am absolutely not OK for WG applying skill-based MM for regular battles. There is nothing more frustrating in the game than having to fight against the windmills with consistently bad teammates. Skill-based MM would punish anyone who is decent in the game. The analysis shows how significant &ldquo;rigging&rdquo; impact already starts for players with 55% WR and above. SO it would not be just few super-unicums who would suffer of this, but anyone who has invested time and effort to learn the game.\nAnd it is not just my personal dislike with bad teammates. Skill-based MM would destroy the incentives to become better in the game. And anyone with bit understanding how crucial the right incentives are for any system involving humans should understands how skill-based MM would be detrimental for the game. It would destroy motivation for the players to learn the game and it would reward players for poor performance. I have played Blitz since 2014 and I am afraid skill-based MM would drive me away from the game unless the rating battles were bearable (I don&rsquo;t think WG&rsquo;s rating formula works).\nWhat&rsquo;s Next? It is now proven that WG now has the technical capability to &ldquo;rig&rdquo; MM and they have applied it in Blitz. The big question now is whether do they apply skill-based MM in Regular Battles. Wargaming is notariously slow in correcting its mistakes - it took more than a year to fix the Spare Parts catastrophe (3.8 - 5.0). If they went to implement skill-based MM into Random &hellip; Regular Battles, it would takes ages from them to reverse their decision. It is therefore important for the playerbase to push WG for not to apply the skill-based MM to the Regular Battles.\nIt is also important to keep monitoring the MM behavior since WG is not too open in their communications. In addition to contacting WG, you can help by submitting consecutive, non-cherry-picked replays from Regular Battles to replaysWoTinspector.com. Either via Discord WoTbot or via email replays@wotinspector.com.\nAnd finally, big thanks to all the hard-working tankers who submitted replays to replays.WoTinspector.com.\n"

    "content": "Stats for update 7.3 have been added.\n Total 230M battles by 484k players recorded in the database during the update 7.3. Please note, these are note all the WoT Blitz players, just those tracked by BlitzAnalysiz[].  \n T28 Concept and Chimera continue to be the best performing tanks in the game. When looking into the details, it is clear that T28 Concept&rsquo;s performance in the hands of average &amp; below-average players (strong armor) pushes its average Relative WR high. The tank is performing well, but relatively bit less well in the hands of very good players. This is likely due to its poor mobility. At the moment the Relative WR data is not stratified. Stratified sampling would eliminate the impact of the differences in the tanks' player populations better and give more comparable view of the tanks' performance.  \nSwedish heavy tank line Update 7.3 brought the Swedish heavy tanks. As it is often the case with new tank lines, those are first played with more experienced &amp; better players distorting the average WR statistics for the tanks. Emil I player population offers a great example:\n\nTier VI Strv 74 Of the Swedish line, the tier VI Strv 74 seems performing below the average. I liked it personally, but based on the numbers it does not perform that well.\n\nTier VII Leo The tier VII Leo seems performing also below the average for the better players. I liked it personally, but maybe its lowish DPM (still higher than the T20) pushed the Relative WR down.\n\nTier VIII Emil I The tier VIII Emil I is the gem of the line and currently the best performing tier VIII Tech Tree heavy tank. Players have been crying it needs to nerfed, but let&rsquo;s remember that the Emil I is only the 4th best performing tier VIII heavy tank. Its superior performance on the battlefield is also greatly contributed by its better-than-average player population (3.9% higher average WR vs. all tier VIII heavy tanks)\n\nTier IX Emil II The tier IX Emil II performed very much the average. I would say the EMil II is perfectly balanced.\n\nTier X Kranvagn The tier X Kranvagn was an disappointment for many and it performs the average (below the average for good players). WG often tends to launch new lines with borderline OP-performance. It might be that WG thought the Kranvagn has so much positives that players would play it in any case, and they decided to launch it as balanced. Launching a new line balanced feels almost like launching it nerfed since the standard is borderline-OP.\n\n"

Fair enough, I was wrong, and WG should go and nerf the Emil I a bit :-)  \n  In general it is great to see Tech Tree tanks taking three spots out of the TOP 5 best performing tanks. The Relative WR figures tend to be bit lower for the new tank lines since many people have been grinding the tank with stock crews and modules. It is not uncommon to see Tech Tree tanks improving their performance stats 1-2 updates since the release. This is despite the fact that I filter out players with too few cumulative battles in a Tech Tree tank to avoid including too many stock tanks in the performance stats.\n  And as anyone playing tiers VI-VII knows, the Annihilator is performing great.\n  \n"

    "content": "A fellow tanker asked a simple question of &ldquo;what is the most OP regular tank in Blitz of all time?&rdquo;. A fair question and something I would have not been able to guess.\nOf course the definition of the &ldquo;best&rdquo; is the one that decides the answer and I have chosen the criteria to be Relative WR - the average of the differences between players' WR in a tank and average WR in their all same tier tanks. And in this case I have calculated it over the time, not during the peak performance of each of the tanks. WG has launched many tank lines with OP tanks, but over the time most of those have been nerfed to reasonable levels or been power-creeped.\nThe most OP regular tanks of all times To my surprise the most OP tank of all times is Emil I. It is not that there never have been more OP regular tanks than Emil I, but those have been nerfed and over the time their &ldquo;average OPness&rdquo; had been brought under more reasonable levels.\nThe most OP regular tanks of all times - Table   Show table      Tank Relative WR Average WR Player WR at Tier Players Battles/Player Vehicle Class Tank type     Emil I 4.7% 56.1% 51.4% 24 296 158 Heavy Tank Researchable   Vickers Cruiser 3.6% 56.7% 53.1% 12 992 247 Light Tank Researchable   LT vz. 38 3.39% 57.2% 53.8% 16 928 68 Light Tank Researchable   Renault R35 2.92% 57.9% 55% 49 963 64 Medium Tank Researchable   Emil II 2.8% 53.1% 50.3% 5 519 207 Heavy Tank Researchable   AT 2 2.18% 53.9% 51.7% 212 099 68 Tank Destroyer Researchable   Maus 2.1% 53.9% 51.8% 30 599 426 Heavy Tank Researchable   Chi-To SPG 2.04% 52.8% 50.8% 27 031 101 Tank Destroyer Researchable   T95 2.02% 53.8% 51.7% 31 932 409 Tank Destroyer Researchable   AMX 50 Foch 2.01% 53.7% 51.7% 24 769 259 Tank Destroyer Researchable   Renault Otsu 1.95% 57.1% 55.2% 47 698 50 Light Tank Researchable   Ho-Ri Type II 1.92% 52.6% 50.6% 9 871 235 Tank Destroyer Researchable   IS-4 1.91% 53.1% 51.2% 49 160 528 Heavy Tank Researchable   S35 CA 1.89% 53.8% 51.9% 117 502 68 Tank Destroyer Researchable   FV4004 Conway 1.86% 54.1% 52.3% 28 732 295 Tank Destroyer Researchable   AMX 50 Foch (155) 1.84% 53.8% 52% 21 682 453 Tank Destroyer Researchable   T1 Heavy Tank 1.82% 53.3% 51.5% 262 443 127 Heavy Tank Researchable   T-34-1 1.75% 53.6% 51.9% 86 983 152 Medium Tank Researchable   AMX 12 t 1.66% 53.1% 51.5% 243 225 108 Light Tank Researchable   Vickers Mk.

Not even close to. It barely fits into the TOP 10. The most OP tank of all the times is of course the legendary Type 98 Ke-Ni Otsu. It was released with wrong parameters and never sold since. WG did not dare to nerf it since some players managed to buy it before WG noticed the mistake.

That&rsquo;s is a big number so let&rsquo;s have a look on the player base.\nCareer WR The chart below shows player&rsquo;s career WR over those 1M players. The career WR distribution seems almost normal distribution, but only almost. The right-hand side &ldquo;tail&rdquo; is reaching further from the mean vs. the left-hand side and the mean WR is above 50%. This seems impossible. This is likely related to the sampling of the players, since more active players are more likely to end up in the the database. Many players (38%) have given up the game or at least have not played in 2021. It seems the the success of the player does not influence on the decision to give up on the game - at least among those who have ended into the database.\nCareer WR table This table shows the career WR of the players as quantiles.\n  Show table      % of Players WR     0% 0%   1% 38.8%   2% 40.1%   3% 40.9%   4% 41.5%   5% 41.9%   10% 43.4%   15% 44.5%   20% 45.3%   25% 46.1%   30% 46.8%   35% 47.4%   40% 48.1%   45% 48.7%   50% 49.4%   55% 50.1%   60% 50.8%   65% 51.6%   70% 52.4%   75% 53.4%   80% 54.6%   85% 56.2%   90% 58.4%   95% 62.2%   96% 63.5%   97% 65.1%   98% 67.3%   99% 71.2%   100% 100%      Length of the Blitz Career The next chart looks how long the players have been playing Blitz so far. The mean is 2.7 years and the chart is surprisingly flat.\nCareer start The following chart shows when did the players start playing Blitz. However, this does not give true picture since the database has been collected only since update 5.3 (2018 September). I do have earlier data sets, but I have not had time to integrate those in the main database for the enjoyment for those handful hard-core Blitz stats nerds. Some day I will. Also strictly speaking it shows the oldest last battle time across the players' tanks. The chart therefore tells how long the players have at least played.\nLatest battle The chart shows when did the players tracked by the site play the last time. Only 50% of the tracked players have played in current month (Feb 2021). The slope of the chart does not indicate the the exodus from the game increasing since also the site has constantly increased the number of players being tracked. But it shows that there is a large player base who do not play Blitz even every month.\n"

Please note, these are note all the WoT Blitz players, just those tracked by BlitzAnalysiz[].\n  Update 7.7 brought new Czechoslovakian tanks and the &ldquo;mighty&rdquo; TVP T 50/51 tops the highest average damage tank list. But is it any good?\n  \n The new event tank Magnus took the 2nd spot on the best performing tanks list while the old, reliable Object 252U took the lead. Other tanks in the TOP 5 are familiar names too: T28 Concept, Annihilator and AT 15A. Chimera (8th) is the only medium tank that gets into TOP 10.  \nCzechoslovakian tanks  Yes, the Czechoslovakian tanks. They seem to be &ldquo;meh&rdquo; at the best. The data is still preliminary so let&rsquo;s see if the final stats will change the picture.  Tier VI Škoda T 25 The tier VI Škoda T 25 appears on the BOTTOM 20 tanks list and even good players seem to struggle with it. So it seems it was not only myself thinking it sucks.\n\nTier VII Konštrukta T-34/100 I personally felt the tier VII Konštrukta T-34/100 was pretty decent, but still it seems to perform below average - even for the skilled players.\n\nTier VIII TVP VTU Koncept The tier VIII TVP VTU Koncept follows the pattern. It performs well below average and sits between known underdogs Panther II and FCM 50 t.\n\nTier IX Škoda T 50 The tier IX Škoda T 50 performs slightly better, but still just average. I personally disliked also this one. It is slow, it has poor armor and its playstyle is boring.\n\nTier X TVP T 50/51 One could expect that the tier X TVP T 50/51 would be a culmination of excitement after all the miserable grind through the mediocre tanks on the line, but it does not seem to perform well at all. Not even for 55%+ players. I know some well-known YouTubers like it and it might be that it performs well only for Super unicums&hellip; Or then it is just exciting to play since based on data it performs below average even for players with 75%+ WR at tier X (I checked).\n\nIf you constantly see TVP T 50/51s to perform superb on the battlefield, that is simply because it is being played by very-very good players on average at this point. The rest of us will soon grind it so the true (non-)performance of the TVP will become apparent.\n\n"

    "content": "I my view, the game became more boring after WG added Vehicle Class Matching rules into the MatchMaker (update 5.1). The exact vehicle class matching rules have been adjusted since, but basically the Vehicle Class Matching limits the number of Tank Destroyers and Light Tanks per team and makes sure there is only +/-1 tank difference between the teams across the vehicle classes. This results mirrored teams causing monotonic battles. In my view, most of the vehicle class matching rules should be abolished, but I know well how I am in the minority here.\nBut the MM is not the main story of this post, but a long intro to the issue at hand - the imbalance of the vehicle classes in the game. I believe WG tried to solve fundamentally a balancing issue through the Vehicle Class Matching -rules. And while there is a logic in their thinking, they could have fixed the root cause instead and do better job balancing the tanks. When looking at the best performing tanks chart above, you can notice how light tanks are completely missing from the list and how the mediums are severely under presented. Heavies and heavily armored TDs rule.\nPerformance Vehicle Classes The average performance of vehicle classes varies per tier and per player skill class. But there are certain patterns I am going to show below. I have used the Update 7.6 data since that is the latest update with full stats available at the moment.\n  Techical details    The calculation of the average Relative WR of a vehicle class has been done without weighting the data with the number of players. This avoids bias caused by hugely popular tanks like Death Star). In practice this means calculating Relative WR for each tank first and then taken averages per vehicle class. This eliminates the bias caused by popular tanks and each tank&rsquo;s relative WR has the same weight regardless of the number of players playing it. However, the tanks played by less than 0.5% of the (tier&rsquo;s) player base have been excluded from the vehicle class averages completely.    Tier X Let&rsquo;s first look at the tier X.\nAll players While the absolute differences are not massive, it is clear that the heavy tanks out-perform all the other vehicle classes when looking the stats over all the players. The light tanks perform the worst as one would expect due to the high skill-floor of those. The heavies on the other hand are often well-armored and more forgiving to drive.\nN = 104135\nLet&rsquo;s now look the performance in different player skill categories.\nPlayers with &lt; 45% WR at Tier X N = 28026\nAs expected, the less-skilled players struggle a lot with the light tanks and do the best with the tank destroyers that allow them to keep distance to the front line. But the stats of the low-skilled players cannot be used for balancing the tanks and vehicle classes.\nPlayers with 45-55% WR at Tier X N = 46173\nFor an average tier X player, the heavy tanks perform the best and the light tanks clearly the worst. The tank destroyers are almost perfectly balanced (on average). This is very much the expected result.\nPlayers with 55-65% WR at Tier X N = 23855\nWargaming has communicated it bases its balancing decisions (commercial motivations set aside) to the performance of the &ldquo;players with 55-65% WR&rdquo;. What exacly does the &ldquo;players with 55-65% WR&rdquo; mean is not completely clear, but this player segment should be close to Wargaming&rsquo;s &ldquo;vehicle balancing focus group&rdquo;.\nFor the 55-65% WR players, the heavy tanks perform even better than for the average players. The medium tanks have improved too and are now perfectly balanced. The tank destroyers have dropped to the 3rd spot and the light tanks continue to drag behind the rest. Clearly the skill-floor of the light tanks is still too high for this player category.\nPlayers with 65%+ WR at Tier X N = 6081\nWhen looking at the very good players (WR 65%+ at tier X), the picture is again bit different. The light tanks perform clearly better are now very well balanced along with the medium tanks. The heavy tanks still perform the best and the tank destroyers have dropped to the last underperform significantly (on average). There are exceptions though like T110E3 and AMX 50 Foch (155)).\nPlayers with 75%+ WR at Tier X I also checked how the Ultra-Super-Unicums (players with 75%+ WR at the tier X) perform. First of all, there are not that many of them (only 584 in the database), but that is still a solid number and there is a solid number of battles (174826) behind the numbers.\nN = 584\nThe gaps between the heavy tanks and the medium and light tanks have now shrunk to irrelevant. But the tank destroyers perform significantly worse. The -3% relative WR difference is at the same level as the difference between Annihilator and Challenger.\nTier X Conclusion It is clear that the heavy tanks outperform all the tank-classes and the tank destroyers underperform (on average). The medium) and light tanks seem balanced although the light tanks have very high skill-floor. Naturally the tank balancing has to be done tank by tank and WG should treat e.g. T110E3 and Grille 15 differently.\nTier IX All players N = 81497\nThe vehicle classes' average performance at Tier IX is bit different than what could be expected. Seeing the light tanks to out-perform the medium tanks among all the players is odd. More about that below.\nPlayers with &lt; 45% WR at tier IX N = 18225\nThe results for the less-skilled players (tier IX WR &lt; 45%) are quite as expected, except that the light tanks out-perform the medium tanks. This is an indication that the tier IX light tanks are very strong strong compared to the medium tank counterparts. The light tanks should have a high skill-floor.\nPlayers with 45-55% WR at tier IX N = 36653\nFor the average players (45-55% WR at tier IX), the heavy tanks outperform the tank destroyers and the medium tanks drag behind others.\nPlayers with 55-65% WR at tier IX N = 20642\nThe WG&rsquo;s &ldquo;vehicle balancing focus group&rdquo; clearly reveals how the tier IX medium tanks underperform. This player category should be able to leverage the better mobility of the medium tanks, but those still perform the worst with a margin .\nPlayers with 65%+ WR at tier IX N = 5977\nThe vehicle class performance in the hands of very good players (Tier IX WR 65%+) clearly show the imbalances at tier IX. The light tanks are outperforming the rest and even the tank destroyers are outperforming the medium tanks. The poor performance of the tier IX medium tanks in the hands of the most skilled players shows how the tier&rsquo;s medium tanks need some buffs. However, the absolute differences are not massive: less than 1% between the best and worst performing vehicle class. The Tier IX is probably the most balanced tier in the game at the moment.\nTier VIII Tier VIII is the most popular tier in the game.\nAll players N = 152191\nAt tier VI, the heavy tanks perform the best and the tank destroyers and medium tanks share the 2nd place. The light tanks underperform the other vehicle classes (as they should for all the players).\nPlayers with &lt; 45% WR at Tier VIII N = 32111\nThe heavy tanks perform the best in the hands of less-skilled players, and the order of vehicle classes is very much in line with the expectations.\nPlayers with 45-55% WR at Tier VIII N = 66365\nThe order stays the same for the average players. No surprises here.\nPlayers with 55-65% WR at Tier VIII N = 41740\nFor the 55-65% player segment the situation changes a bit and the medium tanks take the 2nd place. The poor performance of the light tanks in the hands of good players is not normal but a sign of severe underperformance of the tier VIII LTs. The heavy tanks' lead is so expected that it is easy take it for granted even though it would not have to be so.\nPlayers with 65%+ WR at Tier VIII N = 11975\nThe heavy tanks continue to rule and the light tanks continue to struggle even in the hands of very good players. This is a clear sign of the underperformance of the tier VIII light tanks.\nTiers V-X Let&rsquo;s now look the situation across tiers V-X. The graph below plots the performance of vehicle classes per tier. I am plotting the charts for all the players, and WR 55-65% and WR 65%+ player categories.\nAll players N = 264707\nPlayers with 55-65% WR N = 112325\nPlayers with 65%+ WR N = 35256\nConclusions It should evident from the charts above how the heavy tanks overperform in the game, and how the tank destroyers and light tanks underperform with Tier IX light tanks being a notable exception. The differences between the ends of the spectrum are sizable.\nHow to re-balance the game again? It is easier to point out issues than fix those. And while each tier (and tank) have to be balanced separately, the main re-balancing directions are clear:\n The heavy tanks deserve nerfs across the tiers with tier IX being an exception. The light tanks deserve buffs with tier IX being an exception The tank destroyers deserve buffs across the tiers  The difficult part really is how to re-balance.\nI personally think nerfing the heavy tanks' traverse and turret traverse speeds should be the main ways to achieve the balancing objectives. I think the WG&rsquo;s idea of increasing the heavy tanks' HP pools was a good one and inline with the role of the heavy tanks. Slightly reducing the mobility of the heavy tanks would enforce the differences between medium and heavy tanks and suit their respective roles.\nFor the tank destroyers, I would probably buff camo while stationary and DPM. Buffing TDs, especially the campy, big alpha ones is a controversial topic since many TDs are already hugely popular despite their poor performance. Players just love the big-alpha tanks for the occasional giggles. Buffing those could change the meta towards more &ldquo;campy&rdquo; direction. And this is where the MM&rsquo;s vehicle class matching rules can come handy. Limiting the number of TDs entering the battles would increase the queuing times for those while keeping the battles clean from negative camping-effect of the TDs. This is the only vehicle class matching rule I personally support. Probably three TDs per team sounds like the right limit - unless it becomes a norm.\nBuffing the light tanks is harder. Some of the light tanks deserve engine buffs for better acceleration. Also improved view range could improve the performance while supporting the unique role of the light tanks.\nHaving said all this, I am certain WG&rsquo;s balancing department has far more competence on this area. They know what they are doing even though commercial motives sometimes overrule their balancing rulebook (Annihilator, Smasher, Gravedigger, etc.). The good news is that the Grille line tank destroyers are about to receive buffs in update 7.8 in the form of new consumables (especially Spall Liner). So I believe WG is clearly aware of the current imbalances.\nI hope you enjoyed this longer-than-intended read. Happy tanking and stay safe!\n"

    "content": "Final stats for update 7.7 have been added.\n  In total, there were 236M battles by 481k players recorded in the database during the update 7.7.\n  Familiar &amp; well-armored tanks took the top spots in tank performance rankings: 1) Object 252U, 2) Annihilator and 3) T54E1. There was only one Tech-Tree tank in the TOP 5 (Maus) and two in TOP 10 (AT 8).\n  \n Tier X performance ranking was the same armor-spam: 1) Maus, IS-4, E 100 and so on. All the TOP 10 tanks have a strong armor profile. What is interesting is that the order is pretty much the same for better players (55%+ WR at tier X).  \nCzechoslovakian tanks So how did the Czechoslovakian tanks do? Short answer is: &ldquo;pretty bad&rdquo;, but in reality it is still too early to say. The Relative WR of the Czechoslovakian tanks will likely to improve in the next update as players learn to play the tanks better and a larger share of the player population has finished the stock-grind. Blitzanalysiz[] tries to eliminate the impact of the stock-grind by requiring players to have a tier-specific number of battles in a tank before their stats can be included into the calculations, but that seems not to fully eliminate the stock-grind.\nTier X TVP T 50/51 The tier X TVP T 50/51 performed pretty average being among the lowest 1/3rd. It may have an unique playstyle, but it seem not to perform that well.\n\nIf you constantly see TVP T 50/51s to perform superb on the battlefield, that is simply because it has been played by very-very good players on average at this point. The rest of the players will grind it soon and the true (non-)performance of the tier X TVP will become more apparent.\n\nTier IX Škoda T 50 The tier IX Škoda T 50 performed bit better, but it still just average.\n\nTier VIII TVP VTU Koncept The tier VIII TVP VTU Koncept was a big disappointment to play. Based on stats it was the second worst performing tier VIII medium and the worst performing tier VIII medium for players with 55%+ WR at tier VIII.\n\nTier VII Konštrukta T-34/100 I personally felt the tier VII Konštrukta T-34/100 was pretty decent, but based on stats it was actually one of the worst performing tier VII mediums.\n\nTier VI Škoda T 25 The tier VI Škoda T 25 fits the pattern and was one of the worst performing tier VI medium tanks.\n\nI still cannot believe the Czechoslovakian tanks were so bad. I dislike the tanks, but I believe their stats will fair bit better (i.e. average) in update 7.8. Let&rsquo;s see.\n"

But the best performing tier X medium tanks stayed the same: 1) T-22 medium, 2) Progetto M40 mod. 65 and 3) E 50 Ausf. M.  \n  Finally there is few updates since the Czechoslovakian medium tanks got introduced and it is now fair to say that the early assessment of those being &ldquo;meh&rdquo; at the best was spot-on. The tanks (TVP T 50/51, Škoda T 50, etc.) were performing average across the player skill-levels.\n  The next new line seems to be experimental American heavies ending up to M-VI-Yoh that is being super-tested at the moment by all-but-average players:\n  \nWhile the M-VI-Yoh players are super unicums, the tank seems to perform extremely well for the super-testers even by their own standards.

In other words it is performing below-average for a heavy tank. I found the tank pretty decent.\n\nTier IX - M-V-Yoh The tier IX M-V-Yoh was not so fun tank to play due to its enormous reload time. It performed bit below average.\n\nTier X - M-VI-Yoh The tier X M-VI-Yoh continues the pattern and performed below average. I liked the tank, but I have been fairing pretty poorly with it. I like the dual-shot gun more due to its unique characteristics, but the three-shot autoloader has far better DPM and seems to perform better. WG could give the dual-shot gun bit shorter magazine reload to make it more competitive. There is already T57 Heavy so playing the three-shot gun feels bit &ldquo;meh&rdquo; (IMO) - even it performs better.\n\nIf you have seen the M-VI-Yoh performing well on the battlefield, it is probably since it has been driven by better than average players:\n\n"

WR&#39; = mean(WR), &#39;Player WR&#39; = mean(WR.global), Players=uniqueN(account_id), Battles = sum(all.battles), Premium= unique(is_premium)), by=name ][Players &gt;= min_players][ order(-`Avg.

Blitz has huge number of players who just play few games during the whole update. More than 10% of the players play less than e-i-g-h-t (8) battles during an update. And only small share of those players are ever looked at BlitzStars or happen to be recorded into replays sent to WoTinspector.com, therefore never ending up into Blitzanalysiz.com account database. For this reason I filter players based on minimun battle count requirement for many of the graphs. Otherwise the graphs would show players with 100% WR where in fact they had only one (lucky) game during the whole update.\n"

    "content": "Updated 2020-08-11\nOver-Powered (OP) tanks are maybe the 2nd most popular topic on Blitz YouTube videos and online chats - right after &ldquo;the Matchmaker&rdquo;. I have long held the view that if a tank is &ldquo;OP&rdquo;, this has to be visible in statistics. Otherwise there are only qualitative / subjective views left and those come in all sorts.\nPeople are susceptible to all kinds of biases in their thinking. Getting ammoracked by a Death Star will raise suspicion that the Death Star is an OP tank even though it is actually the worst tier X tank. Anecdotal experiences distort opinions and no one remembers those countless battles where a Death Star was at the bottom of the list. Therefore, tank performance is not a thing that we should vote about, but a thing we can measure with statistics.\nHow to measure performance in the game? Let&rsquo;s discuss first how to measure performance in the game. I am a proponent of win rate being the best measure for performance (player or tank) - not average damage, not average kills, and not speed, not alpha damage or any other attribute or characteristics. The reason for choosing win rate over other variables is the fact that winning is the objective of the game and all the damage, kills, spotting etc. are just means to win the game. Why measure proxy variables when you can measure the final variable itself?\nThere are some caveats in using WR as a performance measure:\n It requires many battles for the WR to settle near one&rsquo;s performance level due to both MM and RNG: It takes 400 battles to reach +/- 5% accuracy, 10000 battles to reach +/- 1% accuracy and whopping 1 million battles to reach 0.1% accuracy with 95% confidence level. Check this link at PC WoT forums for details. Platoon rate impacts on WR but cannot be separated well from the statistics since WG does not publish platoon rate per tank played, but just as a aggregate level over all the tanks. Platooning with a good player can lift one&rsquo;s WR 5-15%. Career WR measures historical average, not one&rsquo;s present performance level, and it reacts slowly once the player has lot (10k+) battles. WG&rsquo;s new &ldquo;newbie MM queue&rdquo; has distorted the Career stats for rerollers big time. This distorts both tank and player average WR. (Just ignore global &amp; career WR). Some tanks are more powerful than others. Comparing different players' WR in different tanks or global WR does not tell us much. Different tiers have different level of difficulty. Global / Average WR is close to useless for measuring player / tank performance. Stock tanks' performance is significantly lower compared to when maxed-out.  But other performance measures have issues too and can be gamed; Easiest way to increase average damage is to play more high tiers and more TDs, WN8 can be gamed by playing popular tech three tanks that are difficult for below average players and not too popular among the unicums.\nDespite all the issues related to WR, I consider it the best performance measure over a large number of battles and in case of tanks, over large number of players since it measures directly the objective of the game (=to win battles). It is also a more understandable measure vs. somewhat abstract indexes. But I believe performance indicators like WN8 which are based on input stats (average damage, kills, spots) give a more accurate view of players' short-term performance (&lt; 100 battles) than WR.\nNow going back to the tank performance.\nSo Average WR it is then, right? Not so fast. Average WR of a tank is a good starter, but it has its own biases. Let&rsquo;s have a look at two tier IX mediums: AMX 30 1er prototype and Prototipo Standard B. Everything here is based on 6.9 data.\n   Tank Average WR Players     Prototipo Standard B 52.5% 9 065   AMX 30 1er prototype 56.4% 4 370    Both tanks have also been played by thousands of players, but the AMX seems to have significantly higher average WR. Many would be tempted to claim the AMX is a better tank than Standard B. But is it?\n  Testing for Statistical significance   As the t-test shows below, the difference in average WR between the tanks is statistically significant with any confidence level.\n## ## Welch Two Sample t-test ## ## data: res[Tank == tanks.post.200608.tank_perf[[1]], `Average WR`] and res[Tank == tanks.post.200608.tank_perf[[2]], `Average WR`] ## t = -20.276, df = 7143.9, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16 ## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## -0.04359091 -0.03590513 ## sample estimates: ## mean of x mean of y ## 0.5245230 0.5642711 ## p-value: 6.4e-89 ## Null hypothesis of the tanks's Relative WR being equal has to be rejected (i.e. there is a statistically significant difference at 99% confidence level    Tank performance is a different variable from player skill Let us first consider a single player and the factors affecting the player&rsquo;s chances to win one battle:\nChance of winning ~ player skill * tank performance + RNG + team performance - enemy team performance\nOver a large number of battles the variables team performance and enemy team performance approach their respective averages and the impact of RNG approaches zero (&ldquo;What RNG gives, RNG takes&rdquo;). The more battles one plays in a tank, only two factors will influence one&rsquo;s WR in it:\nWR ~ player skill * tank performance\nAnd to be more precise, player skill is average player skill in the tank in question. Platooning has been ignored here since unfortunately WG does not publish very usable platooning stats via their API.\nSaying &ldquo;any tank is OP in good players hands&rdquo; is the same as saying &ldquo;any car is fast in the hands of a good driver&rdquo;. While a good driver can make better-than-average lap times with a slow car, a good driver does not make the car any faster, but is just &hellip; a good driver. Give the driver a faster car and they can drive even faster.\nTL;DR. Tank performance and player skill are two separate things\nTanks have different playerbases Let&rsquo;s now go back to the AMX 30 1er prototype vs. Standard B example and compare the playerbases. I have chosen player average WR at the tier as a measure for &ldquo;player skill&rdquo;. And more precisely as measured during the update under study (i.e. not career WR). This eliminates couple of biases:\n WR during the update measures the player&rsquo;s current performance unlike Career WR that measures the average historical performance (re-rollers vs. normal players) It measures player performance at the tier in question unlike average WR over all the tiers, and thus is not distorted by low-tier stats-padding  The plot below shows player WR distribution at tier IX (in any tank) for the both AMX 30 1er prototype and Standard B players. It is clear that the AMX 30 1er prototype is played by better players than Standard B. Stock tank battles (Standard B) have been filtered out based on an estimate of battles required to max-out the tank (139).\n   Tank Avg player WR at Tier IX     Prototipo Standard B 52.7%   AMX 30 1er prototype 56.3%    While both the tanks have been played by thousands of players, the AMX is a premium tank whereas Standard B is a Tech Three tank. The players of the both the tanks are roughly equally experienced (see the histogram graph below), but the AMX players are significantly better on average.\nBut do the differences in the tanks' playerbases explain the difference in Average WR differences or not?\nIntroducing Relative WR To separate the players' skill-level distribution from tank performance, we need to compare players' WR in a tank to their skill-level. As explained above, I have chosen Average WR at the Tier as the measure for player skill. Blitzstars' Tank-Compare uses players' average WR (on any tier) as a measure for player skill in its Relative WR graphs. I have chose to use the WR at the tier in question to eliminate the impact of low-tier stat padding.\nRelative WR(tank) = Average(WR in a tank - Player&rsquo;s WR at the Tier)\nIn a nutshell, Relative WR shows how much more/less the players are winning with the tank vs. their tier average. The higher the Relative WR, the stronger the tank is.\n   Tank Average WR WR at Tier Relative WR Players     Prototipo Standard B 52.6% 52.2% 0.43% 7 956   AMX 30 1er prototype 56.9% 56.7% 0.25% 3 570    The Relative WR graph above shows that players perform a bit better with Standard B than the AMX when compared to their tier IX average. The AMX&rsquo;s average WR is far higher than the Standard B&rsquo;s, but its playerbase is far better too - on average. when the differences in the playerbase are taken into account, the difference becomes small and to the Standard B&rsquo;s advantage. The difference IS statistically significant See significance testing below.\nPremium tanks and new higher tier tank lines are often played by better players than average. This distorts the average WR of those tanks and makes people regard the tanks as OP whereas the fundamental reason can be that the tanks are just being played by better players. Yes, there are many borderline-OP &amp; ridiculously-broken premium tanks, but the Relative WR analysis allows us to separate tank performance from skill-level differences in the tanks' playerbases.\n  Testing for Statistical significance   From statistical perspective the Standard B performs better than the AMX on average. p-value 0.081 well below the limit 0.05 (95% confidence level).\n## ## Welch Two Sample t-test ## ## data: res[Tank == tanks.post.200608.tank_perf[[1]], `Relative WR`] and res[Tank == tanks.post.200608.tank_perf[[2]], `Relative WR`] ## t = 1.7469, df = 5971.7, p-value = 0.0807 ## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## -0.0002202523 0.0038259103 ## sample estimates: ## mean of x mean of y ## 0.004291730 0.002488901 ## p-value: 0.081 ## Null hypothesis of the tanks's Relative WR being equal cannot be rejected (i.e. there is not statistically significant difference at 95% confidence level    TL;DR: Relative WR measures how much higher/lower WR players achieve in a tank vs. their average WR at the same tier.\nOK, is this wall of text over now? Nope.\nPerformance within player skill category The data shows that the Standard B&rsquo;s Relative WR is slightly higher than the AMX 30 1er prototype&rsquo;s - on average - although the difference is not strictly statistically significant. The caveat here is the words on average. How about performance in the hands of below/above average players? Some tanks are known to be difficult for less-skilled players, but well performing in the hands of more skilled players.\nLet&rsquo;s see how the Standard B and the AMX perform when played by different player skill categories.\nPerformance in the hands of super-good players (WR at tier &gt;70%)    Tank Relative WR Players     AMX 30 1er prototype 0.22% 267   Prototipo Standard B 0.48% 158    Standard B seems to perform better than the AMX in the hands of super-good players. However, the player sample is on the small side and the difference is not statistically significant (see below).\n  Testing for Statistical significance   ## ## Welch Two Sample t-test ## ## data: res[Tank == tanks.post.200608.tank_perf[[1]], `Relative WR`] and res[Tank == tanks.post.200608.tank_perf[[2]], `Relative WR`] ## t = 0.56165, df = 313.91, p-value = 0.5748 ## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## -0.006480443 0.011658220 ## sample estimates: ## mean of x mean of y ## 0.004814335 0.002225446 ## p-value: 0.57 ## Null hypothesis of the tanks's Relative WR being equal cannot be rejected (i.e. there is not statistically significant difference at 95% confidence level    Performance in the hands of very good players (WR at tier 60-70%)    Tank Relative WR Players     Prototipo Standard B 0.4% 1 029   AMX 30 1er prototype 0.35% 1 022    When considering only players with 60-70% WR at tier IX, Standard B is still slightly better, but the margin is minuscule. The p-value is 0.8 so the difference is not statistically significant at any reasonable confidence level.\n  Testing for Statistical significance   ## ## Welch Two Sample t-test ## ## data: res[Tank == tanks.post.200608.tank_perf[[1]], `Relative WR`] and res[Tank == tanks.post.200608.tank_perf[[2]], `Relative WR`] ## t = 0.24816, df = 2029.4, p-value = 0.804 ## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## -0.003669481 0.004732673 ## sample estimates: ## mean of x mean of y ## 0.004038950 0.003507354 ## p-value: 0.8 ## Null hypothesis of the tanks's Relative WR being equal cannot be rejected (i.e. there is not statistically significant difference at 95% confidence level    Performance in the hands of good players (WR at tier 50-60%)    Tank Relative WR Players     Prototipo Standard B 0.49% 3 570   AMX 30 1er prototype 0.44% 1 485    For this player category the results have reversed again, and Standard B performs bit better vs. the AMX. This is a large player category in the overall dataset, but still the difference is not statistically significant (p-value is 0.78).\n  Testing for Statistical significance   ## ## Welch Two Sample t-test ## ## data: res[Tank == tanks.post.200608.tank_perf[[1]], `Relative WR`] and res[Tank == tanks.post.200608.tank_perf[[2]], `Relative WR`] ## t = 0.27339, df = 2353.5, p-value = 0.7846 ## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## -0.002847024 0.003769455 ## sample estimates: ## mean of x mean of y ## 0.004875794 0.004414578 ## p-value: 0.78 ## Null hypothesis of the tanks's Relative WR being equal cannot be rejected (i.e. there is not statistically significant difference at 95% confidence level    Performance in the hands of below-average players (WR at tier 40-50%)    Tank Relative WR Players     Prototipo Standard B 0.37% 2 905   AMX 30 1er prototype -0.16% 682    When analyzing players with 40-50% WR at tier IX, Standard B performance clearly better. Considering that this is a large player group, it is easy to understand why Standard B&rsquo;s average Relative WR is higher than the AMX&rsquo;s. My guess is that it is the Standard B&rsquo;s burst DPM that helps the below average players, where as AMX requires more skill in e.g. ridge fighting to perform, even it is a very good tank in the hands of a skilled player. Also, for this player group, the difference in Relative WR is statistically significant (p-value 0.015).\n  Testing for Statistical significance   ## ## Welch Two Sample t-test ## ## data: res[Tank == tanks.post.200608.tank_perf[[1]], `Relative WR`] and res[Tank == tanks.post.200608.tank_perf[[2]], `Relative WR`] ## t = 2.4359, df = 903.2, p-value = 0.01505 ## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## 0.001042643 0.009689074 ## sample estimates: ## mean of x mean of y ## 0.003716970 -0.001648889 ## p-value: 0.015 ## Null hypothesis of the tanks's Relative WR being equal has to be rejected (i.e. there is a statistically significant difference at 95% confidence level    Performance in the hands of well below-average players (WR at tier &lt;40%)    Tank Relative WR Players     Prototipo Standard B 0.35% 292   AMX 30 1er prototype -0.66% 112    Here the difference in Relative WR turns even larger between the tanks. Standard B seems to perform significantly better for players with below-average skills. Again, I suspect the reason being the burst damage. Even the sample size is getting small the difference IS statistically significant (p-value 0.044)).\n  Testing for Statistical significance   ## ## Welch Two Sample t-test ## ## data: res[Tank == tanks.post.200608.tank_perf[[1]], `Relative WR`] and res[Tank == tanks.post.200608.tank_perf[[2]], `Relative WR`] ## t = 2.0256, df = 188, p-value = 0.04422 ## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## 0.0002632513 0.0198760920 ## sample estimates: ## mean of x mean of y ## 0.003496051 -0.006573621 ## p-value: 0.044 ## Null hypothesis of the tanks's Relative WR being equal has to be rejected (i.e. there is a statistically significant difference at 95% confidence level    Final words As you can see, the question of tanks' performance is not that straightforward. Even though average WR is such a common measure for tanks' performance, it fails to separate the impact of the different playerbases from the underlying tank performance. And even when comparing tank&rsquo;s (average) Relative WR it only answers to the question in average - not for very good player or well-below average player.\nTo understand how does a tank perform in the hands of certain skill-level players, the Relative WR analysis can still come handy as it can be run for a specific skill-level players only. Again, the numbers are averages and there are always players who are relatively better on one tank vs other. But the Relative WR analysis per skill-level can help a player to choose tanks they are more likely to perform better with.\nIn case of the AMX 30 1er prototype and Standard B, the differences between the tank performance are mostly insignificant, but not far from being statistically significant. As anyone skilled player who has played those, both the tanks are good. I would call it a draw here since there are far larger imbalances in the game.\nThe graph below shows Relative WR for both the tanks as a function of players' average WR at the tier (IX). The grey area shows the share of players with particular WR at the tier in the dataset. Small sample sizes are likely to cause errors in both the ends of the graph.\nI find it surprising there were differences between the tanks' performance in the 60-70% and 70%+ WR player segments. The absolute differences are not that big and this could go into statistical error tolerances. What may explain the result is the fact that player skill follows broadly normal distribution, thus there are more players with (tier) WR closer to 50% than further away from it. Therefore the 60-70% WR player segment consist of mostly 60-65% players vs. 65-70% players. And there is quite a difference skill still between 60-65% and 70%+ players as I can observe every time I watch e.g. Juicy Tender Steak or Sk8xtrm playing tanks.\nThat&rsquo;s all folks - this time\n"

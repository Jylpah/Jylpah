Relative WR is a measure of the performance of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.1 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players\u0026rsquo; performance in the same tier tanks.

Relative WR is a measure of the performance of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.2 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players\u0026rsquo; performance in the same tier tanks.

Relative WR is a measure of the performance of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.6 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players\u0026rsquo; performance in the same tier tanks.

Relative WR is a measure of the performance of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.8 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players\u0026rsquo; performance in the same tier tanks.

Relative WR is a measure of the performance of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.9 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier.

Player WR denotes the tank\u0026rsquo;s players\u0026rsquo; average WR across all the tanks during the update.\n  Details    Only battles in maxed-out tanks are taken into account. It is assumed that a tank is maxed out if it is a) premium tank or b) player has more than certain number of battles in it in the end of the update (tier dependent: Tier I: 0 battles, Tier X: 152 battles. Since the data is fetched once per update, the stats for just released new Tech-Tree tanks is lower than it should be since the battles players ground the tanks from stock are included in the average.

Player WR denotes the tank\u0026rsquo;s players\u0026rsquo; average WR across all the tanks during the update.\n  Details    Only battles in maxed-out tanks are taken into account. It is assumed that a tank is maxed out if it is a) premium tank or b) player has more than certain number of battles in it in the end of the update (tier dependent: Tier I: 0 battles, Tier X: 152 battles. Since the data is fetched once per update, the stats for just released new Tech-Tree tanks is lower than it should be since the battles players ground the tanks from stock are included in the average. On the other hand new high tier tanks are often ground first by more active and also better players that distorts the average WR. Only tanks with more than 50 players are listed.

Player WR denotes the tank\u0026rsquo;s players\u0026rsquo; average WR across all the tanks during the update.\n  Details    Only battles in maxed-out tanks are taken into account. It is assumed that a tank is maxed out if it is a) premium tank or b) player has more than certain number of battles in it in the end of the update (tier dependent: Tier I: 0 battles, Tier X: 152 battles. Since the data is fetched once per update, the stats for just released new Tech-Tree tanks is lower than it should be since the battles players ground the tanks from stock are included in the average. On the other hand new high tier tanks are often ground first by more active and also better players that distorts the average WR. Only tanks with more than 50 players are listed. This may filter out few upcoming tanks that are being tested.    Highest Average WR - Table Average WR denotes average WR in a tank accross all the players during the update.

This is a measure of the performance of the tank.   Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.2 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players\u0026rsquo; performance in the same tier tanks.   \nHighest Relative WR - Table   Show table      Tank Relative WR Average WR Players Battles Tank type Player WR at Tier     T28 Concept 4.2 57.5 1007 77112 Premium 53.4   Object 252U 4.1 59.6 2212 155840 Premium 55.5   KV-220 Beta-Test 4.0 63.8 248 21090 Premium 59.9   WZ-120-1G FT 2.8 59.8 2393 252041 Premium 56.9   T28 Defender 2.8 56.0 1622 117670 Premium 53.2   WZ-112-2 2.7 56.2 471 32290 Premium 53.5   Maus 2.6 55.1 1650 136137 Researchable 52.5   LT vz. 38 2.5 62.3 323 11854 Researchable 59.7   Smasher 2.4 60.5 2113 350466 Premium 58.0   IS-3 Defender 2.4 57.3 2689 492460 Premium 54.9   Churchill Mk.

This is a measure of the performance of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.3 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players\u0026rsquo; performance in the same tier tanks.

It is assumed that a tank is maxed out if it is a) premium tank or b) player has more than certain number of battles in it in the end of the update (tier dependent: Tier I: 0 battles, Tier X: 152 battles. Since the data is fetched once per update, the stats for just released new Tech-Tree tanks is lower than it should be since the battles players ground the tanks from stock are included in the average.

This is a measure of the performance of the tank.   Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.4 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players\u0026rsquo; performance in the same tier tanks.   \nHighest Relative WR - Table   Show table      Tank Relative WR Average WR Players Battles Tank type Player WR at Tier     T28 Concept 4.4 57.8 679 43451 Premium 53.4   KV-220 Beta-Test 3.9 63.7 239 23977 Premium 59.8   Object 252U 3.5 58.2 1330 103502 Premium 54.7   T1 Heavy Tank 3.0 57.2 2827 203837 Researchable 54.2   Progetto M35 mod. 46 2.7 71.7 163 15994 Premium 69.1   WZ-120-1G FT 2.5 59.3 2302 227013 Premium 56.9   VK 36.01 (H) 2.4 54.9 3752 269106 Researchable 52.6   WZ-112-2 2.3 56.0 688 39312 Premium 53.7   T28 Defender 2.3 55.3 1235 88450 Premium 53.0   Pz.Kpfw.

Player WR denotes the tank\u0026rsquo;s players\u0026rsquo; average WR across all the tanks during the update.\n  Details    Only battles in maxed-out tanks are taken into account. It is assumed that a tank is maxed out if it is a) premium tank or b) player has more than certain number of battles in it in the end of the update (tier dependent: Tier I: 0 battles, Tier X: 152 battles. Since the data is fetched once per update, the stats for just released new Tech-Tree tanks is lower than it should be since the battles players ground the tanks from stock are included in the average. On the other hand new high tier tanks are often ground first by more active and also better players that distorts the average WR. Only tanks with more than 50 players are listed. This may filter out few upcoming tanks that are being tested.    Highest Average WR - Table Average WR denotes average WR in a tank accross all the players during the update.

Player WR denotes the tank\u0026rsquo;s players\u0026rsquo; average WR across all the tanks during the update.\n  Details    Only battles in maxed-out tanks are taken into account. It is assumed that a tank is maxed out if it is a) premium tank or b) player has more than certain number of battles in it in the end of the update (tier dependent: Tier I: 0 battles, Tier X: 152 battles. Since the data is fetched once per update, the stats for just released new Tech-Tree tanks is lower than it should be since the battles players ground the tanks from stock are included in the average. On the other hand new high tier tanks are often ground first by more active and also better players that distorts the average WR. Only tanks with more than 50 players are listed. This may filter out few upcoming tanks that are being tested.    Highest Average WR - Table Average WR denotes average WR in a tank accross all the players during the update.

Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players\u0026rsquo; performance in the same tier tanks.

Player WR denotes the tank\u0026rsquo;s players\u0026rsquo; average WR across all the tanks during the update.\n  Details    Only battles in maxed-out tanks are taken into account. It is assumed that a tank is maxed out if it is a) premium tank or b) player has more than certain number of battles in it in the end of the update (tier dependent: Tier I: 0 battles, Tier X: 152 battles. Since the data is fetched once per update, the stats for just released new Tech-Tree tanks is lower than it should be since the battles players ground the tanks from stock are included in the average. On the other hand new high tier tanks are often ground first by more active and also better players that distorts the average WR. Only tanks with more than 50 players are listed. This may filter out few upcoming tanks that are being tested.    Highest Average WR - Table Average WR denotes average WR in a tank accross all the players during the update.

This is a measure of the performance of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.8 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier.

It is assumed that a tank is maxed out if it is a) premium tank or b) player has more than certain number of battles in it in the end of the update (tier dependent: Tier I: 0 battles, Tier X: 152 battles. Since the data is fetched once per update, the stats for just released new Tech-Tree tanks is lower than it should be since the battles players ground the tanks from stock are included in the average. On the other hand new high tier tanks are often ground first by more active and also better players that distorts the average WR. Only tanks with more than 50 players are listed. This may filter out few upcoming tanks that are being tested.    Highest Average WR - Table Average WR denotes average WR in a tank accross all the players during the update.

Relative WR is a measure of the performance of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.1 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier.

Relative WR is a measure of the performance of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.2 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players\u0026rsquo; performance in the same tier tanks.

Relative WR is a measure of the performance of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.5 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier.

Relative WR is a measure of the performance of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.6 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players\u0026rsquo; performance in the same tier tanks.

Relative WR is a measure of the performance of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.9 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players\u0026rsquo; performance in the same tier tanks.

Relative WR is a measure of the performance of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.9 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players\u0026rsquo; performance in the same tier tanks.

Relative WR is a measure of the performance of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.0 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier.

Relative WR is a measure of the performance of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.0 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players\u0026rsquo; performance in the same tier tanks.

Relative WR is a measure of the performance of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.2 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players\u0026rsquo; performance in the same tier tanks.

Relative WR is a measure of the performance of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.4 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier.

Relative WR is a measure of the performance of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.6 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players\u0026rsquo; performance in the same tier tanks.

Relative WR is a measure of the performance of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.8 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players\u0026rsquo; performance in the same tier tanks.

I have long presented that if a tank is “OP”, it has to be visible in statistics.\n 2020-05-16 Stats since update 6.0 added  I have been busy cleaning up the codebase and fixing tons of little issues. Here are main updates: Stats since update 6.0 I have added stats for updates since 6.0 to the site.\n 2020-05-07 Blitzanalysiz.com launched  Hy!\nBlitzAnalysiz.com is a site about in-depth game statistics of Wargaming\u0026rsquo;s World of Tanks Blitz. You won\u0026rsquo;t find individial player statistics here - for those, please check awesome Blitzstars.com.

Relative WR is a measure of the performance of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.0 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players\u0026rsquo; performance in the same tier tanks.

Relative WR is a measure of the performance of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.1 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier.

Relative WR is a measure of the performance of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.4 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier.

Relative WR is a measure of the performance of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.6 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier.

Relative WR is a measure of the performance of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.9 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players\u0026rsquo; performance in the same tier tanks.

Relative WR is a measure of the performance of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.9 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players\u0026rsquo; performance in the same tier tanks.

Instead, the graphs tell more about the player sampling per server. BlitzAnalysiz() database has relatively more players from EU and NA (com) servers vs. RU and Asia servers. In all the servers the players sampled are on average more active and better than the true player average due to the way how the player account_ids are being harvested. More active and better players are more likely to be searched on BlitzStars.com and get recorded into WoTinspector.com replays, which are the two main sources of account_ids for BlitzAnalysiz().\n Cumulative distribution function This graphs shows the same information than the previous in different format.

The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier.

Relative WR is a measure of the performance of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.0 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier.

Relative WR is a measure of the performance of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.2 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players\u0026rsquo; performance in the same tier tanks.

Relative WR is a measure of the performance of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.4 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players\u0026rsquo; performance in the same tier tanks.

Relative WR is a measure of the performance of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.6 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players\u0026rsquo; performance in the same tier tanks.

Relative WR is a measure of the performance of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.8 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players\u0026rsquo; performance in the same tier tanks.

Relative WR is a measure of the performance of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.1 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players\u0026rsquo; performance in the same tier tanks.

Relative WR is a measure of the performance of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.5 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules).

Relative WR is a measure of the performance of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.1 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players\u0026rsquo; performance in the same tier tanks.

The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players\u0026rsquo; performance in the same tier tanks.

Relative WR is a measure of the performance of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.9 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players\u0026rsquo; performance in the same tier tanks.

Relative WR is a measure of the performance of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.9 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players\u0026rsquo; performance in the same tier tanks.

Relative WR is a measure of the performance of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.5 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players\u0026rsquo; performance in the same tier tanks.

	"content": "1. Where is the data from All the data has been collected from WG API, stored in a database and processed with R/RStudio.\n2. Are your numbers correct? Is there bias in the numbers? The statistics have been calculated from a data set with very high number of players (600,000+) and battles (in total 6bn+). That is maybe 4 times the users Blitzstars.com has, but there is still sampling bias as there is any Blitz stats tracker site. This is evidenced by the overall WR distribution and the share of all wins out of all the battles in the database being above 50%. This is a topic worth of a longer post - stay tuned.\n3. Why did you make the site? Out of pure interest into analysizing Blitz game statistics and to learn data analysis and R.\n4. What is \u0026ldquo;Relative WR\u0026rdquo;? Relative WR the average WR players achieve with the tank compared to their other same tier tanks. If the tank is perfectly balanced, its Relative WR is 0 %. Large positive Relative WR indicates the tank is \u0026ldquo;very good\u0026rdquo; (read \u0026ldquo;OP\u0026rdquo;). Negative Relative WR indicate the tank performce worse than other same tier tanks. Relative WR is the 2nd best measure of tank\u0026rsquo;s performance, IMHO.\n  Relative WR R code   rWR = Relative WR\nstats.data.table[, WR.tier := sum(all.wins)/battles.tier, by=.(account_id, tier)]; stats.data.table[, tanks.tier := .N, by=.(account_id, tier)]; stats.data.table[ tanks.tier \u0026gt; 1, rWR := WR - (battles.tier*WR.tier - all.wins)/(battles.tier - all.battles)]; The bit cryptic syntax is R\u0026rsquo;s data.table - one of the fastest software packages for data analysis.\n  5. Is BlitzAnalysiz()\u0026rsquo; Relative WR different from Blitzstars\u0026rsquo; one? Yes. At the moment Blitzstars.com calculate the Relative WR as WR difference to the players\u0026rsquo; average WR over all their tanks. BlitzAnalysiz() considers only the other same tier tanks. Please note that the tank itself is excluded of the average WR in BlitzAnalysiz()\u0026rsquo; calculations, but included in BlitzStars\u0026rsquo; calculations. This may extra cause bias with hugely popular tanks.\n6. I spotted a mistake or I have a question/request All the feedback on the site is welcome.

	"title": "Measuring tank performance",
	"tags": ["post"],
	"description": "",
	"content": "Over-Powered (OP) tanks are maybe the 2nd most popular topic on Blitz YouTube videos and online chats - right after “the Matchmaker”. I have long presented that if a tank is “OP”, it has to be visible in statistics. Otherwise there is only qualitative / subjective views left and those come in all sorts.\nPeople are susceptible to all kinds of biases in their thinking. Getting ammoracked by a Death Star will raise suspicion that Death Star is an OP tank even it is actually the worst tier X tank. Anecdotal experiences distort opinions and no one remembers those countless of battles where a DS was at the bottom on the list. Therefore, tank performance is not a thing that we should vote about, but a thing we can measure with statistics.\nHow to measure performance in the game? Let’s discuss first how to measure performance in the game. I am a proponent of win rate being the best measure for performance (player or tank)– not average damage, not average kills, and not speed, not alpha damage or any other attribute or characteristics. The reason for choosing win rate over other variables is the fact that winning is the objective of the game and all the damage, kills, spotting etc. are just means to win the game. Why to measure the proxy variables when you can measure the final variable itself?\nThere are caveats in using WR as performance measure:\n It requires lot of battles for WR to settle near one’s performance level due to both MM and RNG: It take 400 battles to reach +/- 5% accuracy, 10000 battles to reach +/- 1% accuracy and 1 million battles! to reach 0.1% accuracy with 95% confidence level. Check this link at PC WoT forums for details. Platoon rate impacts on WR but cannot be distilled well from the stats since WG does not publish detailed platoon rate per tank played. Platooning with a good player can lift one’s WR 5-15%. Career WR measures historical average, not one’s present performance level, and reacts slowly once the player has lot (10k+) battles. WG’s new “newbie MM queue” has distorted the Career stats for rerollers big time. This distorts both tank and player average WR. (Just ignore global \u0026amp; career WR). Some tanks are more powerful than other. Comparing different players’ WR in different tanks or global WR does not tell much. Different tiers have different level of difficulty. Global / Average WR is close to useless in measuring player / tank performance. Stock tanks’ performance is significantly lower compared to maxed-out tanks’ performance.  But other performance measures have issues too and can be gamed; Easiest way to increase average damage play more high tiers and more TDs, WN8 can be gamed by playing popular tech three tanks that are difficult for below average players and not too popular among the unicums. Despite all the issues related to WR, I consider it the best performance measure over large number of battles and in case of tanks, over large number of players since it measures directly the objective of the game (=to win battles). It is also more understandable measure vs. somewhat abstract indexes. But I believe performance indicators like WN8 which based on “input stats” (average damage, kills, spots) give more accurate view on players’ short-term performance (\u0026lt; 100 battles). Now going back to the tank performance.\nSo Average WR it is then, right? Not so fast. Average WR of a tank is a good starter, but it itself has its own biases. Let’s have a look on two tier IX mediums: AMX 30 1er prototype and Prototipo Standard B. Everything here is based on 6.9 data.\n   Tank Average WR Players     Prototipo Standard B 52.3 7622   AMX 30 1er prototype 56.5 3414    Both the tanks have been also played by thousands of players, but the AMX seems to have significantly higher average WR. Many would be tempted to claim the AMX is a better tank than Standard B. But is it?\nTank performance is a different variable from player skill Let us first consider a single player and the factors affecting one’s chances to win one battle:\nChance of winning ~ player skill * tank performance + RNG + team performance – enemy team performance\nOver a large number of battles the variables “team performance” and “enemy team performance” approach their respective averages and the impact of RNG approaches zero (“What RNG gives, RNG takes”). The more battles on plays with a tank, only two factors will influence one’s WR in it:\nWR ~ player skill * tank performance\nAnd to be more precise, player skill is average player skill in the tank in question. Platooning has been ignored here since unfortunately WG does not publish very usable platooning stats via their API.\nSaying “any tank is OP in good players hands” is the same as saying “any car is fast in the hands of a good driver”. While a good driver can make better-than-average lap times with a slow car, a good driver does not make the car any faster, but is just … a good driver. Give the driver a faster car and they can drive even faster.\nTL;DR. Tank performance and player skill are two separate things\nTanks have different playerbases Let’s now go back to the AMX 30 1er prototype vs. Standard B example and compare the playerbases. I have chosen player average WR at the tier as a measure for “player skill”. And more precisely as measured during the update under study (i.e. not career WR). This eliminates couple of biases:\n WR during the update measures the player’s current performance unlike Career WR that measures the average historical performance (re-rollers vs. normal players) It measures player performance at the tier in question unlike average WR over all the tiers, and thus is not distorted by low-tier stats-padding  The plot below shows player WR distribution at tier IX (in any tank) for the both AMX 30 1er prototype and Standard B players. It is clear that the AMX 30 1er prototype is played by better players than Standard B.\n   Tank Avg player WR at Tier IX     Prototipo Standard B 51.7   AMX 30 1er prototype 56.1    While both the tanks have been played by thousands of players, the AMX is a premium tank whereas Standard B is a Tech Three tank. Both the tanks’ players are roughly equally experienced (see the histogram graph below), but the AMX players are significantly better on average.\nBut do the differences in the tanks’ playerbases explain the difference in Average WR differences or not?\nIntroducing Relative WR To separate the players’ skill-level distribution from tank performance, we need to compare players’ WR in a tank to their skill-level. As explained above, I have chosen Average WR at the Tier as the measure for player skill. Blitzstars’ Tank-Compare uses players’ average WR (on any tier) as a measure for player skill in its Relative WR graphs. I have chose to use the WR at the tier in question to eliminate the impact of low-tier stats padding.\nRelative WR(tank) = Average(WR in a tank - Player’s WR at the Tier)\nIn a nutshell, Relative WR shows how much more the players are winning with the tank vs. their tier average. The higher the Relative WR, the stronger the tank is.\n   Tank Average WR WR at Tier Relative WR Players     Prototipo Standard B 52.6 51.6 0.9 6562   AMX 30 1er prototype 56.8 56.1 0.7 3146    Relative WR graph above shows that players perform better with Standard B than the AMX when compared their tier IX average. The AMX’s average WR is far higher than the Standard B’s, but so is its playerbase far better – on average. Both the tanks have been played by thousands of players, so the results have not been distorted by a small sample.\nPremium tanks and new higher tier tank lines are often played by better players than average. This distorts the average WR of those tanks and makes people to regard the tanks as OP whereas the fundamental reason can be that the tanks are just being played by better players. Yes, there are many borderline-OP \u0026amp; ridiculously-broken premium tanks, but by the Relative WR analysis allows us to separate tank performance out of skill-level differences in the tanks’ playerbases.\nTL;DR: Relative WR measures how much higher/lower WR players achieve in a tank vs. their average WR at the same tier.\nOK, is this wall of text over now? Nope.\nPerformance within player skill category The data shows how Standard B’s Relative WR is higher than the AMX 30 1er prototype’s – on average. And caveat here the words on average. How about performance in the hands of below/above average players? Some tanks are known to be difficult for less-skilled players, but well performing in the hands of more skilled players. Let’s see how do Standard B and the AMX perform when played by different player skill category.\nPerformance in the hands of super-good players (WR at tier \u0026gt;70%) Standard B seems to perform significantly better than the AMX in the hands of super-good players. However, the player sample is bit on the small side although not miniscule.\n   Tank Relative WR Players     AMX 30 1er prototype 0.5 166   Prototipo Standard B 1.3 85    Performance in the hands of very good players (WR at tier 60-70%) When considering only players with 60-70% WR at tier IX, we can see how the tide has changed and the AMX is performing better than Standard B with a 0.5% margin. This is not a massive difference, but not a small either. There are also 729-868 players in the data set, so the sample is not that small either. I find it interesting there is difference in the tanks’ performance between the 60-70% and 70%+ WR player segments.\n   Tank Relative WR Players     AMX 30 1er prototype 1.1 868   Prototipo Standard B 0.6 729    Performance in the hands of good players (WR at tier 50-60%) For this player category the results have reversed again, and Standard B performs better vs. the AMX. This is a large player category in the overall dataset.\n   Tank Relative WR Players     Prototipo Standard B 1.0 2968   AMX 30 1er prototype 0.7 1359    Performance in the hands of below-average players (WR at tier 40-50%) When analyzing players with 40-50% WR at tier IX, Standard B performance clearly better. Considering that this is a large player group, it is easy to understand why Standard B’s average Relative WR is higher than the AMX’s. My guess is that it is the Standard B’s burst DPM that helps the below average players, where as AMX requires more skill in e.g. ridge fighting to perform, even it is a very good tank in the hands of a skilled player.\n   Tank Relative WR Players     Prototipo Standard B 0.9 2519   AMX 30 1er prototype 0.3 654    Performance in the hands of well below-average players (WR at tier \u0026lt;40%) Here the difference in Relative WR turns even larger between the tanks. Standard B performs significantly better for players with below-average skills. Again, I suspect the reason being the burst damage.\n   Tank Relative WR Players     Prototipo Standard B 1.2 261   AMX 30 1er prototype 0.4 98    Final words As you can see, the question of tanks’ performance is not that straightforward. Even though average WR is such a common measure for tanks\u0026rsquo; performance, it fails to separate the impact of the different playerbases from the underlying tank performance. And even when comparing tank’s (average) Relative WR it only answers to the question in average – not for very good player or well-below average player.\nTo understand how does a tank perform - still on average - in the hands of certain skill level players, the Relative WR analysis can still come handy as it can be run for a specific skill-level players only. Again, the numbers are averages and there are always players who are relatively better with TDs or light tanks or American tanks vs. Soviet tanks, etc. But the Relative WR analysis per skill-level can help a player to choose they are more likely to perform better with.\nThe graph below shows Relative WR for both the tanks as a function of players’ average WR at the tier (IX). The grey area shows the share of players with particular WR at the tier in the dataset. Small sample sizes are likely to cause errors in both the ends of the graph.\nI find it surprising there was such a large difference between the tanks’ performance for 60-70% and 70% player segments. What may explain the result is the fact that player skill follows broadly normal distribution, thus there are more players with (tier) WR closer to 50% than further away from it. Therefore the 60-70% WR player segment consist of mostly 60-65% players vs. 65-70% players. And there is quite a difference skill still between 60-65% and 70%+ players as I can observe every time I watch e.g. Juicy Tender Steak playing tanks.\nThat’s all folks – this time\n"

	"content": "I have been busy cleaning up the codebase and fixing tons of little issues. Here are main updates:\nStats since update 6.0 I have added stats for updates since 6.0 to the site. Please note that while certain graphs like WR vs. Battles played - update 6.0 show big differences between 6.0 and 6.9, the changes in the underlying game statistics are likely less, but are caused just BlitzAnalysiz() colleting data more players and especially more new/less active players.\nUpdate 6.0 Update 6.9 Graph templates Now the code is much more manageable weith new graph templates. Previously each graph was a copy-paste from the previous similar one (and with little changes along the line) making it hard to manage the code as I discovered issues and fixed bugs. I can now add a new graph (as long as I have a template for the graph type), just with few lines of code like this:\nres \u0026lt;- head(stats.update[DT_filter_battles_tank(all.battles, all.battles.new, tier, is_premium), .(\u0026#39;Average WR\u0026#39; = mean(WR), \u0026#39;Player WR\u0026#39; = mean(WR.global), \u0026#39;Players\u0026#39; = uniqueN(account_id), \u0026#39;Battles\u0026#39; = sum(all.battles), \u0026#39;Premium\u0026#39; = first(is_premium)), by=name ][Players \u0026gt;= min_players][ order(-`Average WR`)],n=topN); res \u0026lt;- prep_plot_tank(res,\u0026#39;Average WR\u0026#39;) title = get_plot_title_top_tanks(\u0026#39;Average WR\u0026#39;, topN = 20) plot_col_discrete_2Y(res,title, \u0026#39;Tank\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Average WR\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Player WR\u0026#39;, fill_var = \u0026#39;Tank type\u0026#39;)    ...instead of this:   res \u0026lt;- head(stats.update[, .(\u0026#39;Avg. WR\u0026#39; = mean(WR), \u0026#39;Player WR\u0026#39; = mean(WR.global), Players=uniqueN(account_id), Battles = sum(all.battles), Premium= unique(is_premium)), by=name ][Players \u0026gt;= min_players][ order(-`Avg. WR`)],n=topN); setnames(res, \u0026#39;name\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Tank\u0026#39;); res[, `Avg. WR`:=`Avg. WR` * 100]; res[, `Player WR`:=`Player WR` * 100]; res[Premium==TRUE, `Tank type`:=\u0026#39;Premium\u0026#39;] res[Premium==FALSE, `Tank type`:= \u0026#39;Researchable\u0026#39;] res[,`Tank type` := as.factor(`Tank type`)] res[,Premium := NULL] setcolorder(res,c(\u0026#39;Tank\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Avg.

WR`, (function (x) -x)), y = `Avg.

Blitz has huge number of players who just play few games during the whole update. More than 10% of the players play less than e-i-g-h-t (8) battles during an update. And only small share of those players are ever looked at BlitzStars or happen to be recorded into replays sent to WoTinspector.com, therefore never ending up into Blitzanalysiz.com account database. For this reason I filter players based on minimun battle count requirement for many of the graphs. Otherwise the graphs would show players with 100% WR where in fact they had only one (lucky) game during the whole update.\n"

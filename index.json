Relative WR is a measure of the performance of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.1 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 5-30 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank are included Only players with 10-60 battles at the tier (tier depended) during the update are included. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR is the average WR of the players of the tank in all the other same tier tanks. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players\u0026rsquo; performance in the same tier tanks.

Relative WR is a measure of the performance of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.7 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 5-30 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank are included Only players with 10-60 battles at the tier (tier depended) during the update are included. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR is the average WR of the players of the tank in all the other same tier tanks. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players\u0026rsquo; performance in the same tier tanks.

Relative WR is a measure of the performance of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.9 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 5-30 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank are included Only players with 10-60 battles at the tier (tier depended) during the update are included. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR is the average WR of the players of the tank in all the other same tier tanks.

Relative WR is a measure of the performance of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.1 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 5-30 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank are included Only players with 10-60 battles at the tier (tier depended) during the update are included. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR is the average WR of the players of the tank in all the other same tier tanks. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players\u0026rsquo; performance in the same tier tanks.

Relative WR is a measure of the performance of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.0 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 5-30 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank are included Only players with 10-60 battles at the tier (tier depended) during the update are included. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR is the average WR of the players of the tank in all the other same tier tanks. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players\u0026rsquo; performance in the same tier tanks.

Relative WR is a measure of the performance of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.2 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 5-30 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank are included Only players with 10-60 battles at the tier (tier depended) during the update are included. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR is the average WR of the players of the tank in all the other same tier tanks. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players\u0026rsquo; performance in the same tier tanks.

The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 5-30 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank are included Only players with 10-60 battles at the tier (tier depended) during the update are included. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR is the average WR of the players of the tank in all the other same tier tanks.

Relative WR is a measure of the performance of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.5 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 5-30 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank are included Only players with 10-60 battles at the tier (tier depended) during the update are included. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR is the average WR of the players of the tank in all the other same tier tanks. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players\u0026rsquo; performance in the same tier tanks.

Relative WR is a measure of the performance of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.8 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 5-30 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank are included Only players with 10-60 battles at the tier (tier depended) during the update are included. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR is the average WR of the players of the tank in all the other same tier tanks. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players\u0026rsquo; performance in the same tier tanks.

The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 5-30 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank are included Only players with 10-60 battles at the tier (tier depended) during the update are included. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR is the average WR of the players of the tank in all the other same tier tanks. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players\u0026rsquo; performance in the same tier tanks.

Relative WR is a measure of the performance of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.1 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 5-30 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank are included Only players with 10-60 battles at the tier (tier depended) during the update are included. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR is the average WR of the players of the tank in all the other same tier tanks. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players\u0026rsquo; performance in the same tier tanks.

Relative WR is a measure of the performance of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.4 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 5-30 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank are included Only players with 10-60 battles at the tier (tier depended) during the update are included. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR is the average WR of the players of the tank in all the other same tier tanks. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players\u0026rsquo; performance in the same tier tanks.

The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 5-30 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank are included Only players with 10-60 battles at the tier (tier depended) during the update are included.

Relative WR is a measure of the performance of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.1 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 5-30 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank are included Only players with 10-60 battles at the tier (tier depended) during the update are included. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR is the average WR of the players of the tank in all the other same tier tanks. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players\u0026rsquo; performance in the same tier tanks.

Relative WR is a measure of the performance of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.9 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 5-30 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank are included Only players with 10-60 battles at the tier (tier depended) during the update are included. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR is the average WR of the players of the tank in all the other same tier tanks. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players\u0026rsquo; performance in the same tier tanks.

Relative WR is a measure of the performance of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.9 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 5-30 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank are included Only players with 10-60 battles at the tier (tier depended) during the update are included. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR is the average WR of the players of the tank in all the other same tier tanks.

The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 5-30 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank are included Only players with 10-60 battles at the tier (tier depended) during the update are included.

	"content": "1. Where is the data from All the data has been collected from WG API, stored in a database and processed with R/RStudio.\n2. Are your numbers correct? Is there bias in the numbers? The statistics have been calculated from a data set with very high number of players (600,000+) and battles (in total 6bn+). That is maybe 4 times the data Blitzstars.com has, but there is still sampling bias as there is in Blitzstars\u0026rsquo; numbers. This is evidenced by the overall WR distribution and the share of all wins out of all the battles in the database being above 50%. This is a topic worth of a longer post - stay tuned.\n3. Why did you make the site? Out of pure interest into analysizing Blitz game statistics and to learn data analysis and R.\n4. What is \u0026ldquo;Relative WR\u0026rdquo;? Relative WR the average WR players achieve with the tank compared to their other same tier tanks. If the tank is perfectly balanced, its Relative WR is 0 %. Large positive Relative WR indicates the tank is \u0026ldquo;very good\u0026rdquo; (read \u0026ldquo;OP\u0026rdquo;). Negative Relative WR indicate the tank performce worse than other same tier tanks. Relative WR is the 2nd best measure of tank\u0026rsquo;s performance, IMHO.\n  Relative WR R code   rWR = Relative WR\nstats.data.table[, WR.tier := sum(all.wins)/battles.tier, by=.(account_id, tier)]; stats.data.table[, tanks.tier := .N, by=.(account_id, tier)]; stats.data.table[ tanks.tier \u0026gt; 1, rWR := WR - (battles.tier*WR.tier - all.wins)/(battles.tier - all.battles)]; The bit cryptic syntax is R\u0026rsquo;s data.table - one of the fastest software packages for data analysis.\n  5. Is BlitzAnalysiz()\u0026rsquo; Relative WR different from Blitzstars\u0026rsquo; one? Yes. At the moment Blitzstars.com calculate the Relative WR as WR difference to the players\u0026rsquo; average WR over all their tanks. BlitzAnalysiz() considers only the other same tier tanks. Please note that the tank itself is excluded of the average WR in BlitzAnalysiz()\u0026rsquo; calculations, but included in BlitzStars\u0026rsquo; calculations. This may extra cause bias with hugely popular tanks.\n6. I spotted a mistake or I have a question/request All the feedback on the site is welcome.

	"content": "I have been busy cleaning up the codebase and fixing tons of little issues. Here are main updates:\nStats since update 6.0 I have added stats for updates since 6.0 to the site. Please note that while certain graphs like WR vs. Battles played - update 6.0 show big differences between 6.0 and 6.9, the changes in the underlying game statistics are likely less, but are caused just BlitzAnalysiz() colleting data more players and especially more new/less active players.\nUpdate 6.0 Update 6.9 Graph templates Now the code is much more manageable weith new graph templates. Previously each graph was a copy-paste from the previous similar one (and with little changes along the line) making it hard to manage the code as I discovered issues and fixed bugs. I can now add a new graph (as long as I have a template for the graph type), just with few lines of code like this:\nres \u0026lt;- head(stats.update[DT_filter_battles_tank(all.battles, all.battles.new, tier, is_premium), .(\u0026#39;Average WR\u0026#39; = mean(WR), \u0026#39;Player WR\u0026#39; = mean(WR.global), \u0026#39;Players\u0026#39; = uniqueN(account_id), \u0026#39;Battles\u0026#39; = sum(all.battles), \u0026#39;Premium\u0026#39; = first(is_premium)), by=name ][Players \u0026gt;= min_players][ order(-`Average WR`)],n=topN); res \u0026lt;- prep_plot_tank(res,\u0026#39;Average WR\u0026#39;) title = get_plot_title_top_tanks(\u0026#39;Average WR\u0026#39;, topN = 20) plot_col_discrete_2Y(res,title, \u0026#39;Tank\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Average WR\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Player WR\u0026#39;, fill_var = \u0026#39;Tank type\u0026#39;)    ...instead of this:   res \u0026lt;- head(stats.update[, .(\u0026#39;Avg.

Blitz has huge number of players who just play few games during the whole update. More than 10% of the players play less than e-i-g-h-t (8) battles during an update. And only small share of those players are ever looked at BlitzStars or happen to be recorded into replays sent to WoTinspector.com, therefore never ending up into Blitzanalysiz.com account database. For this reason I filter players based on minimun battle count requirement for many of the graphs. Otherwise the graphs would show players with 100% WR where in fact they had only one (lucky) game during the whole update.\n"

You can reach out me via email (Jylpah@gmail.com), Discord (Jylpah#4662). I am also active at WoT Blitz EU forums.\n"

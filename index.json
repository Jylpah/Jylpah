The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules).

Relative WR is a measure of the performance of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.0 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players\u0026rsquo; performance in the same tier tanks.

	"content": "The Best Performing Tanks Relative WR The graph shows the tanks the players win the most compared to their average WR at the tier. The measure is called Relative WR and it is a measure of the performance/strength of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.1 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players\u0026rsquo; performance in the same tier tanks.

	"content": "The Best Performing Tanks Relative WR The graph shows the tanks the players win the most compared to their average WR at the tier. The measure is called Relative WR and it is a measure of the performance/strength of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.10 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players\u0026rsquo; performance in the same tier tanks.

Relative WR is a measure of the performance of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.2 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players\u0026rsquo; performance in the same tier tanks.

	"content": "The Best Performing Tanks Relative WR The graph shows the tanks the players win the most compared to their average WR at the tier. The measure is called Relative WR and it is a measure of the performance/strength of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.3 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players\u0026rsquo; performance in the same tier tanks.

Relative WR is a measure of the performance of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.4 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players\u0026rsquo; performance in the same tier tanks.

	"content": "The Best Performing Tanks Relative WR The graph shows the tanks the players win the most compared to their average WR at the tier. The measure is called Relative WR and it is a measure of the performance/strength of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.5 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players\u0026rsquo; performance in the same tier tanks.

Relative WR is a measure of the performance of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.5 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players\u0026rsquo; performance in the same tier tanks.

Relative WR is a measure of the performance of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.6 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players\u0026rsquo; performance in the same tier tanks.

	"content": "The Best Performing Tanks Relative WR The graph shows the tanks the players win the most compared to their average WR at the tier. The measure is called Relative WR and it is a measure of the performance/strength of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.7 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players\u0026rsquo; performance in the same tier tanks.

Relative WR is a measure of the performance of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.8 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players\u0026rsquo; performance in the same tier tanks.

	"content": "The Best Performing Tanks Relative WR The graph shows the tanks the players win the most compared to their average WR at the tier. The measure is called Relative WR and it is a measure of the performance/strength of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.9 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players\u0026rsquo; performance in the same tier tanks.

This is a measure of the performance of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.10 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players\u0026rsquo; performance in the same tier tanks.

	"content": "The Best Performing Tanks Relative WR The graph shows tanks with the highest average of players\u0026rsquo; WR in the tank compared to the players\u0026rsquo; WR at the same tier (in all tanks). This is a measure of the performance of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.2 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players\u0026rsquo; performance in the same tier tanks.

Player WR denotes the tank\u0026rsquo;s players\u0026rsquo; average WR across all the tanks during the update.\n  Details    Only battles in maxed-out tanks are taken into account. It is assumed that a tank is maxed out if it is a) premium tank or b) player has more than certain number of battles in it in the end of the update (tier dependent: Tier I: 0 battles, Tier X: 152 battles. Since the data is fetched once per update, the stats for just released new Tech-Tree tanks is lower than it should be since the battles players ground the tanks from stock are included in the average. On the other hand new high tier tanks are often ground first by more active and also better players that distorts the average WR. Only tanks with more than 50 players are listed. This may filter out few upcoming tanks that are being tested.    Highest Average WR - Table Average WR denotes average WR in a tank accross all the players during the update.

It is assumed that a tank is maxed out if it is a) premium tank or b) player has more than certain number of battles in it in the end of the update (tier dependent: Tier I: 0 battles, Tier X: 152 battles. Since the data is fetched once per update, the stats for just released new Tech-Tree tanks is lower than it should be since the battles players ground the tanks from stock are included in the average. On the other hand new high tier tanks are often ground first by more active and also better players that distorts the average WR. Only tanks with more than 50 players are listed. This may filter out few upcoming tanks that are being tested.    Highest Average WR - Table Average WR denotes average WR in a tank accross all the players during the update.

Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules).

This is a measure of the performance of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.5 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier.

It is assumed that a tank is maxed out if it is a) premium tank or b) player has more than certain number of battles in it in the end of the update (tier dependent: Tier I: 0 battles, Tier X: 152 battles. Since the data is fetched once per update, the stats for just released new Tech-Tree tanks is lower than it should be since the battles players ground the tanks from stock are included in the average.

	"content": "The Best Performing Tanks Relative WR The graph shows tanks with the highest average of players\u0026rsquo; WR in the tank compared to the players\u0026rsquo; WR at the same tier (in all tanks). This is a measure of the performance of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.6 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players\u0026rsquo; performance in the same tier tanks.

Player WR denotes the tank\u0026rsquo;s players\u0026rsquo; average WR across all the tanks during the update.\n  Details    Only battles in maxed-out tanks are taken into account. It is assumed that a tank is maxed out if it is a) premium tank or b) player has more than certain number of battles in it in the end of the update (tier dependent: Tier I: 0 battles, Tier X: 152 battles. Since the data is fetched once per update, the stats for just released new Tech-Tree tanks is lower than it should be since the battles players ground the tanks from stock are included in the average. On the other hand new high tier tanks are often ground first by more active and also better players that distorts the average WR. Only tanks with more than 50 players are listed. This may filter out few upcoming tanks that are being tested.    Highest Average WR - Table Average WR denotes average WR in a tank accross all the players during the update.

Since the data is fetched once per update, the stats for just released new Tech-Tree tanks is lower than it should be since the battles players ground the tanks from stock are included in the average. On the other hand new high tier tanks are often ground first by more active and also better players that distorts the average WR. Only tanks with more than 50 players are listed. This may filter out few upcoming tanks that are being tested.    Highest Average WR - Table Average WR denotes average WR in a tank accross all the players during the update.

This is a measure of the performance of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.8 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players\u0026rsquo; performance in the same tier tanks.

	"content": "The Best Performing Tanks Relative WR The graph shows tanks with the highest average of players\u0026rsquo; WR in the tank compared to the players\u0026rsquo; WR at the same tier (in all tanks). This is a measure of the performance of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.9 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players\u0026rsquo; performance in the same tier tanks.

Player WR denotes the tank\u0026rsquo;s players\u0026rsquo; average WR across all the tanks during the update.\n  Details    Only battles in maxed-out tanks are taken into account. It is assumed that a tank is maxed out if it is a) premium tank or b) player has more than certain number of battles in it in the end of the update (tier dependent: Tier I: 0 battles, Tier X: 152 battles. Since the data is fetched once per update, the stats for just released new Tech-Tree tanks is lower than it should be since the battles players ground the tanks from stock are included in the average. On the other hand new high tier tanks are often ground first by more active and also better players that distorts the average WR. Only tanks with more than 50 players are listed. This may filter out few upcoming tanks that are being tested.    Highest Average WR - Table Average WR denotes average WR in a tank accross all the players during the update.

	"content": "The Best Performing Tanks Relative WR The graph shows the tanks the players win the most compared to their average WR at the tier. The measure is called Relative WR and it is a measure of the performance/strength of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.1 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players\u0026rsquo; performance in the same tier tanks.

Relative WR is a measure of the performance of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.10 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players\u0026rsquo; performance in the same tier tanks.

	"content": "The Best Performing Tanks Relative WR The graph shows the tanks the players win the most compared to their average WR at the tier. The measure is called Relative WR and it is a measure of the performance/strength of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.2 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players\u0026rsquo; performance in the same tier tanks.

	"content": "The Best Performing Tanks Relative WR The graph shows the tanks the players win the most compared to their average WR at the tier. The measure is called Relative WR and it is a measure of the performance/strength of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.3 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier.

Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players\u0026rsquo; performance in the same tier tanks.

Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier.

	"content": "The Best Performing Tanks Relative WR The graph shows the tanks the players win the most compared to their average WR at the tier. The measure is called Relative WR and it is a measure of the performance/strength of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.6 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier.

	"content": "The Best Performing Tanks Relative WR The graph shows the tanks the players win the most compared to their average WR at the tier. The measure is called Relative WR and it is a measure of the performance/strength of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.7 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players\u0026rsquo; performance in the same tier tanks.

The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier.

Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players\u0026rsquo; performance in the same tier tanks.

	"content": "The Best Performing Tanks Relative WR The graph shows the tanks the players win the most compared to their average WR at the tier. The measure is called Relative WR and it is a measure of the performance/strength of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.9 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players\u0026rsquo; performance in the same tier tanks.

The measure is called Relative WR and it is a measure of the performance/strength of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.0 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules).

The measure is called Relative WR and it is a measure of the performance/strength of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.1 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update.

	"content": "The Best Performing Tanks Relative WR The graph shows the tanks the players win the most compared to their average WR at the tier. The measure is called Relative WR and it is a measure of the performance/strength of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.10 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players\u0026rsquo; performance in the same tier tanks.

Relative WR is a measure of the performance of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.10 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players\u0026rsquo; performance in the same tier tanks.

	"content": "The Best Performing Tanks Relative WR The graph shows the tanks the players win the most compared to their average WR at the tier. The measure is called Relative WR and it is a measure of the performance/strength of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.2 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier.

	"content": "The Best Performing Tanks Relative WR The graph shows the tanks the players win the most compared to their average WR at the tier. The measure is called Relative WR and it is a measure of the performance/strength of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.3 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players\u0026rsquo; performance in the same tier tanks.

Relative WR is a measure of the performance of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.3 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players\u0026rsquo; performance in the same tier tanks.

	"content": "The Best Performing Tanks Relative WR The graph shows the tanks the players win the most compared to their average WR at the tier. The measure is called Relative WR and it is a measure of the performance/strength of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.4 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players\u0026rsquo; performance in the same tier tanks.

	"content": "The Best Performing Tanks Relative WR The graph shows the tanks the players win the most compared to their average WR at the tier. The measure is called Relative WR and it is a measure of the performance/strength of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.5 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players\u0026rsquo; performance in the same tier tanks.

Relative WR is a measure of the performance of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.5 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players\u0026rsquo; performance in the same tier tanks.

	"content": "The Best Performing Tanks Relative WR The graph shows the tanks the players win the most compared to their average WR at the tier. The measure is called Relative WR and it is a measure of the performance/strength of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.6 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players\u0026rsquo; performance in the same tier tanks.

	"content": "The Best Performing Tanks Relative WR The graph shows the tanks the players win the most compared to their average WR at the tier. The measure is called Relative WR and it is a measure of the performance/strength of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.7 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier.

	"content": "The Best Performing Tanks Relative WR The graph shows the tanks the players win the most compared to their average WR at the tier. The measure is called Relative WR and it is a measure of the performance/strength of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.8 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players\u0026rsquo; performance in the same tier tanks.

Relative WR is a measure of the performance of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.8 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players\u0026rsquo; performance in the same tier tanks.

	"content": "The Best Performing Tanks Relative WR The graph shows the tanks the players win the most compared to their average WR at the tier. The measure is called Relative WR and it is a measure of the performance/strength of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.9 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier.

Was T92E1 still one of the best performing tier IX tanks?\n 2020-06-08 Measuring tank performance  Updated 2020-06-17 Over-Powered (OP) tanks are maybe the 2nd most popular topic on Blitz YouTube videos and online chats - right after “the Matchmaker”. I have long held the view that if a tank is “OP”, this has to be visible in statistics.\n 2020-05-16 Stats since update 6.0 added  I have been busy cleaning up the codebase and fixing tons of little issues. Here are main updates: Stats since update 6.0 I have added stats for updates since 6.0 to the site.\n 2020-05-07 BlitzAnalysiz.com launched  Hy!\nBlitzAnalysiz.com is a site about in-depth game statistics of Wargaming\u0026rsquo;s World of Tanks Blitz.

The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update.

Relative WR is a measure of the performance of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.0 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players\u0026rsquo; performance in the same tier tanks.

The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier.

The measure is called Relative WR and it is a measure of the performance/strength of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.10 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules).

The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players\u0026rsquo; performance in the same tier tanks.

Relative WR is a measure of the performance of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.2 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players\u0026rsquo; performance in the same tier tanks.

The measure is called Relative WR and it is a measure of the performance/strength of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.3 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier.

The measure is called Relative WR and it is a measure of the performance/strength of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.4 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules).

The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players\u0026rsquo; performance in the same tier tanks.

Relative WR is a measure of the performance of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.5 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier.

	"content": "The Best Performing Tanks Relative WR The graph shows the tanks the players win the most compared to their average WR at the tier. The measure is called Relative WR and it is a measure of the performance/strength of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.7 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players\u0026rsquo; performance in the same tier tanks.

Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players\u0026rsquo; performance in the same tier tanks.

Relative WR is a measure of the performance of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.8 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players\u0026rsquo; performance in the same tier tanks.

The measure is called Relative WR and it is a measure of the performance/strength of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.9 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players\u0026rsquo; performance in the same tier tanks.

The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules).

Relative WR is a measure of the performance of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.0 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players\u0026rsquo; performance in the same tier tanks.

	"content": "The Best Performing Tanks Relative WR The graph shows the tanks the players win the most compared to their average WR at the tier. The measure is called Relative WR and it is a measure of the performance/strength of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.1 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier.

	"content": "The Best Performing Tanks Relative WR The graph shows the tanks the players win the most compared to their average WR at the tier. The measure is called Relative WR and it is a measure of the performance/strength of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.10 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players\u0026rsquo; performance in the same tier tanks.

The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules).

	"content": "The Best Performing Tanks Relative WR The graph shows the tanks the players win the most compared to their average WR at the tier. The measure is called Relative WR and it is a measure of the performance/strength of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.4 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players\u0026rsquo; performance in the same tier tanks.

	"content": "The Best Performing Tanks Relative WR The graph shows the tanks the players win the most compared to their average WR at the tier. The measure is called Relative WR and it is a measure of the performance/strength of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.5 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players\u0026rsquo; performance in the same tier tanks.

Relative WR is a measure of the performance of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.6 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players\u0026rsquo; performance in the same tier tanks.

	"content": "The Best Performing Tanks Relative WR The graph shows the tanks the players win the most compared to their average WR at the tier. The measure is called Relative WR and it is a measure of the performance/strength of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.7 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players\u0026rsquo; performance in the same tier tanks.

	"content": "The Best Performing Tanks Relative WR The graph shows the tanks the players win the most compared to their average WR at the tier. The measure is called Relative WR and it is a measure of the performance/strength of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.8 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players\u0026rsquo; performance in the same tier tanks.

Relative WR is a measure of the performance of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.9 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players\u0026rsquo; performance in the same tier tanks.

The measure is called Relative WR and it is a measure of the performance/strength of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.0 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier.

Relative WR is a measure of the performance of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.0 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players\u0026rsquo; performance in the same tier tanks.

	"content": "The Best Performing Tanks Relative WR The graph shows the tanks the players win the most compared to their average WR at the tier. The measure is called Relative WR and it is a measure of the performance/strength of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.1 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players\u0026rsquo; performance in the same tier tanks.

	"content": "The Best Performing Tanks Relative WR The graph shows the tanks the players win the most compared to their average WR at the tier. The measure is called Relative WR and it is a measure of the performance/strength of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.2 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players\u0026rsquo; performance in the same tier tanks.

Relative WR is a measure of the performance of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.4 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players\u0026rsquo; performance in the same tier tanks.

The measure is called Relative WR and it is a measure of the performance/strength of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.5 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier.

	"content": "The Best Performing Tanks Relative WR The graph shows the tanks the players win the most compared to their average WR at the tier. The measure is called Relative WR and it is a measure of the performance/strength of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.7 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players\u0026rsquo; performance in the same tier tanks.

Relative WR is a measure of the performance of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.9 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier.

The measure is called Relative WR and it is a measure of the performance/strength of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.1 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update.

	"content": "The Best Performing Tanks Relative WR The graph shows the tanks the players win the most compared to their average WR at the tier. The measure is called Relative WR and it is a measure of the performance/strength of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.10 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players\u0026rsquo; performance in the same tier tanks.

	"content": "The Best Performing Tanks Relative WR The graph shows the tanks the players win the most compared to their average WR at the tier. The measure is called Relative WR and it is a measure of the performance/strength of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.5 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier.

	"content": "The Best Performing Tanks Relative WR The graph shows the tanks the players win the most compared to their average WR at the tier. The measure is called Relative WR and it is a measure of the performance/strength of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.6 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier.

	"content": "The Best Performing Tanks Relative WR The graph shows the tanks the players win the most compared to their average WR at the tier. The measure is called Relative WR and it is a measure of the performance/strength of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.7 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players\u0026rsquo; performance in the same tier tanks.

Relative WR is a measure of the performance of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.9 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players\u0026rsquo; performance in the same tier tanks.

The measure is called Relative WR and it is a measure of the performance/strength of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.0 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier.

Relative WR is a measure of the performance of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.0 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players\u0026rsquo; performance in the same tier tanks.

	"content": "The Best Performing Tanks Relative WR The graph shows the tanks the players win the most compared to their average WR at the tier. The measure is called Relative WR and it is a measure of the performance/strength of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.1 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier.

The measure is called Relative WR and it is a measure of the performance/strength of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.10 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier.

	"content": "The Best Performing Tanks Relative WR The graph shows the tanks the players win the most compared to their average WR at the tier. The measure is called Relative WR and it is a measure of the performance/strength of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.2 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players\u0026rsquo; performance in the same tier tanks.

The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules).

	"content": "The Best Performing Tanks Relative WR The graph shows the tanks the players win the most compared to their average WR at the tier. The measure is called Relative WR and it is a measure of the performance/strength of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.6 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players\u0026rsquo; performance in the same tier tanks.

	"content": "The Best Performing Tanks Relative WR The graph shows the tanks the players win the most compared to their average WR at the tier. The measure is called Relative WR and it is a measure of the performance/strength of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.7 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier.

	"content": "The Best Performing Tanks Relative WR The graph shows the tanks the players win the most compared to their average WR at the tier. The measure is called Relative WR and it is a measure of the performance/strength of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.8 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players\u0026rsquo; performance in the same tier tanks.

Relative WR is a measure of the performance of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.9 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players\u0026rsquo; performance in the same tier tanks.

	"content": "2020-06-17 Stats added for update 6.10 Also fixed a bug in the code (function params in wrong order..) that likely caused too many tank stats being filtered out.\n2020-06-08 Changes to stats filtering and Relative WR algo Stats filtering unified to eliminate stock-grind tanks\u0026rsquo; impact on tank performance stats (Averate WR, Relative WR, Average damage, etc.). Earlier new tanks got impacted by the stock-grind battles being taken into account. The number of required battle is a compromise based on average tank research XP divided by players\u0026rsquo; average XP at the tier and divided by 1.5^2. This can be intepreted as playing with 50% WR and only the first 2x XP victories plus XP boosters. Making the filter too aggressive seriously limits the available data, therefore the compromise.\nRequired number of battles per tier\n   1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10     0 1 4 9 18 34 51 86 139 152    Relative WR formula revised to do the comparison to average of all the same tier tanks, including the tank itself. This seems to provide more sensible results than the earlier using other same tier tanks as the comparison point. Honestly speaking, I do not know why. The first algorithm seemed clever, but the detailed graphs showed it failed somehow.\nThe first Relative WR incarnation also had an error that while it filtered out stock-grind tanks, it included those in the calculation of the comparison WR (i.e. average WR of other same tier tanks). This caused RElative WR to be higher for all the tanks than it actually was.\n2020-06-08 New blog post: Measuring tank performance 2020-05-16 Stats since update 6.0 added Stats since Update 6.0 added. Graphs are also now based on plot templates to unify look\u0026rsquo;n\u0026rsquo; feel.\n2020-05-07 BlitzAnalysiz.com launched "

The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules).

Relative WR is a measure of the performance of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.10 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players\u0026rsquo; performance in the same tier tanks.

	"content": "The Best Performing Tanks Relative WR The graph shows the tanks the players win the most compared to their average WR at the tier. The measure is called Relative WR and it is a measure of the performance/strength of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.2 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players\u0026rsquo; performance in the same tier tanks.

	"content": "The Best Performing Tanks Relative WR The graph shows the tanks the players win the most compared to their average WR at the tier. The measure is called Relative WR and it is a measure of the performance/strength of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.3 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players\u0026rsquo; performance in the same tier tanks.

	"content": "The Best Performing Tanks Relative WR The graph shows the tanks the players win the most compared to their average WR at the tier. The measure is called Relative WR and it is a measure of the performance/strength of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.4 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players\u0026rsquo; performance in the same tier tanks.

	"content": "The Best Performing Tanks Relative WR The graph shows the tanks the players win the most compared to their average WR at the tier. The measure is called Relative WR and it is a measure of the performance/strength of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.5 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier.

The measure is called Relative WR and it is a measure of the performance/strength of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.6 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules).

	"content": "The Best Performing Tanks Relative WR The graph shows the tanks the players win the most compared to their average WR at the tier. The measure is called Relative WR and it is a measure of the performance/strength of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.8 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players\u0026rsquo; performance in the same tier tanks.

Relative WR is a measure of the performance of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.9 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players\u0026rsquo; performance in the same tier tanks.

	"content": "The Best Performing Tanks Relative WR The graph shows the tanks the players win the most compared to their average WR at the tier. The measure is called Relative WR and it is a measure of the performance/strength of the tank.\n  Show details    All the statistics are about battles fought during the update 6.5 only. The impact of \u0026ldquo;Stock-grind battles\u0026rdquo; is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than 0-152 (depending on the tier) battles in a tank in the end of the update are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules). The players need to have 10-20 battles in a tank and 20-40 battles at the tier during the update. Average WR is the players\u0026rsquo;s average WR in the tank Player WR at Tier is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier.

	"content": "1. Where is the data from All the data has been collected from Wargaming API and processed with R/RStudio.\n2. Are your numbers correct? Is there bias in the numbers? The statistics have been calculated from a data set with very high number of players (600,000+) and battles (in total 6bn+). That is maybe 4 times the users Blitzstars.com has. However, there is still sampling bias as there is any Blitz stats tracker site. This is evidenced by the overall WR distribution and the share of all wins out of all the battles in the database being above 50%. This is a topic worth of a longer post - stay tuned.\n3. Why did you make the site? Out of pure interest into analysizing Blitz game statistics and to learn data analysis and R.\n4. What is \u0026ldquo;Relative WR\u0026rdquo;? Relative WR the average of player WR in a tank minus their Average WR in all the same tier tanks. If the tank is perfectly balanced, its Relative WR is 0 %. Large positive Relative WR indicates the tank is \u0026ldquo;very good\u0026rdquo; (read \u0026ldquo;OP\u0026rdquo;). Negative Relative WR indicate the tank performce worse than other same tier tanks. Relative WR is one of the better (if not the best) best measures for tank performance since it takes the skill differences in tanks\u0026rsquo; playerbases into account, IMHO.\n  Relative WR R code   rWR = Relative WR\nstats[DT_filter_battles_grind(all.battles.new, tier, is_premium), WR.tier := sum(all.wins)/sum(all.battles), by=.(account_id, tier)]; stats[DT_filter_battles_grind(all.battles.new, tier, is_premium), tanks.tier := .N, by=.(account_id, tier)]; stats[ , rWR := 0]; stats[ (tanks.tier \u0026gt; 1) \u0026amp; DT_filter_battles_tank(all.battles, tier), rWR := WR - WR.tier]; The bit cryptic syntax is R\u0026rsquo;s data.table - one of the fastest software packages for data analysis.\n  5. Is BlitzAnalysiz()\u0026rsquo; Relative WR different from Blitzstars\u0026rsquo; one? Yes, a bit. At the moment Blitzstars.com calculate the Relative WR as WR difference to the players\u0026rsquo; average WR over all their tanks. BlitzAnalysiz() considers only the other same tier tanks. The real differences are likely rather small.\n6. I spotted a mistake or I have a question/request All the feedback on the site is welcome. You can reach out me via email (Jylpah@gmail.com), Discord (Jylpah#4662). I am also active at WoT Blitz EU forums.\n"

	"content": "I have been busy cleaning up the codebase and fixing tons of little issues. Here are main updates:\nStats since update 6.0 I have added stats for updates since 6.0 to the site. Please note that while certain graphs like WR vs. Battles played - update 6.0 show big differences between 6.0 and 6.9, the changes in the underlying game statistics are likely less, but are caused just BlitzAnalysiz() colleting data more players and especially more new/less active players.\nUpdate 6.0 Update 6.9 Graph templates Now the code is much more manageable weith new graph templates. Previously each graph was a copy-paste from the previous similar one (and with little changes along the line) making it hard to manage the code as I discovered issues and fixed bugs. I can now add a new graph (as long as I have a template for the graph type), just with few lines of code like this:\nres \u0026lt;- head(stats.update[DT_filter_battles_tank(all.battles, all.battles.new, tier, is_premium), .(\u0026#39;Average WR\u0026#39; = mean(WR), \u0026#39;Player WR\u0026#39; = mean(WR.global), \u0026#39;Players\u0026#39; = uniqueN(account_id), \u0026#39;Battles\u0026#39; = sum(all.battles), \u0026#39;Premium\u0026#39; = first(is_premium)), by=name ][Players \u0026gt;= min_players][ order(-`Average WR`)],n=topN); res \u0026lt;- prep_plot_tank(res,\u0026#39;Average WR\u0026#39;) title = get_plot_title_top_tanks(\u0026#39;Average WR\u0026#39;, topN = 20) plot_col_discrete_2Y(res,title, \u0026#39;Tank\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Average WR\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Player WR\u0026#39;, fill_var = \u0026#39;Tank type\u0026#39;)    ...instead of this:   res \u0026lt;- head(stats.update[, .(\u0026#39;Avg.

Blitz has huge number of players who just play few games during the whole update. More than 10% of the players play less than e-i-g-h-t (8) battles during an update. And only small share of those players are ever looked at BlitzStars or happen to be recorded into replays sent to WoTinspector.com, therefore never ending up into Blitzanalysiz.com account database. For this reason I filter players based on minimun battle count requirement for many of the graphs. Otherwise the graphs would show players with 100% WR where in fact they had only one (lucky) game during the whole update.\n"

	"title": "Measuring tank performance",
	"tags": ["post"],
	"description": "",
	"content": "Updated 2020-06-17\nOver-Powered (OP) tanks are maybe the 2nd most popular topic on Blitz YouTube videos and online chats - right after “the Matchmaker”. I have long held the view that if a tank is “OP”, this has to be visible in statistics. Otherwise there are only qualitative / subjective views left and those come in all sorts.\nPeople are susceptible to all kinds of biases in their thinking. Getting ammoracked by a Death Star will raise suspicion that the Death Star is an OP tank even though it is actually the worst tier X tank. Anecdotal experiences distort opinions and no one remembers those countless battles where a Death Star was at the bottom of the list. Therefore, tank performance is not a thing that we should vote about, but a thing we can measure with statistics.\nHow to measure performance in the game? Let’s discuss first how to measure performance in the game. I am a proponent of win rate being the best measure for performance (player or tank)– not average damage, not average kills, and not speed, not alpha damage or any other attribute or characteristics. The reason for choosing win rate over other variables is the fact that winning is the objective of the game and all the damage, kills, spotting etc. are just means to win the game. Why measure proxy variables when you can measure the final variable itself?\nThere are some caveats in using WR as a performance measure:\n It requires many battles for the WR to settle near one’s performance level due to both MM and RNG: It takes 400 battles to reach +/- 5% accuracy, 10000 battles to reach +/- 1% accuracy and whopping 1 million battles to reach 0.1% accuracy with 95% confidence level. Check this link at PC WoT forums for details. Platoon rate impacts on WR but cannot be separated well from the statistics since WG does not publish platoon rate per tank played, but just as a aggregate level over all the tanks. Platooning with a good player can lift one’s WR 5-15%. Career WR measures historical average, not one’s present performance level, and it reacts slowly once the player has lot (10k+) battles. WG’s new “newbie MM queue” has distorted the Career stats for rerollers big time. This distorts both tank and player average WR. (Just ignore global \u0026amp; career WR). Some tanks are more powerful than others. Comparing different players’ WR in different tanks or global WR does not tell us much. Different tiers have different level of difficulty. Global / Average WR is close to useless for measuring player / tank performance. Stock tanks’ performance is significantly lower compared to when maxed-out.  But other performance measures have issues too and can be gamed; Easiest way to increase average damage is to play more high tiers and more TDs, WN8 can be gamed by playing popular tech three tanks that are difficult for below average players and not too popular among the unicums.\nDespite all the issues related to WR, I consider it the best performance measure over a large number of battles and in case of tanks, over large number of players since it measures directly the objective of the game (=to win battles). It is also a more understandable measure vs. somewhat abstract indexes. But I believe performance indicators like WN8 which are based on “input stats” (average damage, kills, spots) give a more accurate view of players’ short-term performance (\u0026lt; 100 battles) than WR.\nNow going back to the tank performance.\nSo Average WR it is then, right? Not so fast. Average WR of a tank is a good starter, but it has its own biases. Let’s have a look at two tier IX mediums: AMX 30 1er prototype and Prototipo Standard B. Everything here is based on 6.9 data.\n   Tank Average WR Players     Prototipo Standard B 52.3 7622   AMX 30 1er prototype 56.5 3414    Both tanks have also been played by thousands of players, but the AMX seems to have significantly higher average WR. Many would be tempted to claim the AMX is a better tank than Standard B. But is it?\n  Testing for Statistical significance   As the t-test shows below, the difference in average WR between the tanks is statistically significant with any confidence level.\n## ## Welch Two Sample t-test\r## ## data: res[Tank == tanks.post.200608.tank_perf[[1]], `Average WR`] and res[Tank == tanks.post.200608.tank_perf[[2]], `Average WR`]\r## t = -19.695, df = 5498.2, p-value \u0026lt; 2.2e-16\r## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0\r## 95 percent confidence interval:\r## -4.701283 -3.850087\r## sample estimates:\r## mean of x mean of y ## 52.26063 56.53632\r## p-value: 1.7e-83\r## Null hypothesis of the tanks's Relative WR being equal has to be rejected (i.e. there is a statistically significant difference at 99% confidence level\r   Tank performance is a different variable from player skill Let us first consider a single player and the factors affecting the player\u0026rsquo;s chances to win one battle:\nChance of winning ~ player skill * tank performance + RNG + team performance – enemy team performance\nOver a large number of battles the variables “team performance” and “enemy team performance” approach their respective averages and the impact of RNG approaches zero (“What RNG gives, RNG takes”). The more battles one plays in a tank, only two factors will influence one’s WR in it:\nWR ~ player skill * tank performance\nAnd to be more precise, player skill is average player skill in the tank in question. Platooning has been ignored here since unfortunately WG does not publish very usable platooning stats via their API.\nSaying “any tank is OP in good players hands” is the same as saying “any car is fast in the hands of a good driver”. While a good driver can make better-than-average lap times with a slow car, a good driver does not make the car any faster, but is just … a good driver. Give the driver a faster car and they can drive even faster.\nTL;DR. Tank performance and player skill are two separate things\nTanks have different playerbases Let’s now go back to the AMX 30 1er prototype vs. Standard B example and compare the playerbases. I have chosen player average WR at the tier as a measure for “player skill”. And more precisely as measured during the update under study (i.e. not career WR). This eliminates couple of biases:\n WR during the update measures the player’s current performance unlike Career WR that measures the average historical performance (re-rollers vs. normal players) It measures player performance at the tier in question unlike average WR over all the tiers, and thus is not distorted by low-tier stats-padding  The plot below shows player WR distribution at tier IX (in any tank) for the both AMX 30 1er prototype and Standard B players. It is clear that the AMX 30 1er prototype is played by better players than Standard B. Stock tank battles (Standard B) have been filtered out based on an estimate of battles required to max-out the tank (139).\n   Tank Avg player WR at Tier IX     Prototipo Standard B 52.2   AMX 30 1er prototype 56.7    While both the tanks have been played by thousands of players, the AMX is a premium tank whereas Standard B is a Tech Three tank. Both the tanks’ players are roughly equally experienced (see the histogram graph below), but the AMX players are significantly better on average.\nBut do the differences in the tanks’ playerbases explain the difference in Average WR differences or not?\nIntroducing Relative WR To separate the players’ skill-level distribution from tank performance, we need to compare players’ WR in a tank to their skill-level. As explained above, I have chosen Average WR at the Tier as the measure for player skill. Blitzstars’ Tank-Compare uses players’ average WR (on any tier) as a measure for player skill in its Relative WR graphs. I have chose to use the WR at the tier in question to eliminate the impact of low-tier stat padding.\nRelative WR(tank) = Average(WR in a tank - Player’s WR at the Tier)\nIn a nutshell, Relative WR shows how much more/less the players are winning with the tank vs. their tier average. The higher the Relative WR, the stronger the tank is.\n   Tank Average WR WR at Tier Relative WR Players     Prototipo Standard B 52.6 52.1 0.5 5937   AMX 30 1er prototype 56.7 56.6 0.1 2650    The Relative WR graph above shows that players perform a bit better with Standard B than the AMX when compared to their tier IX average. The AMX’s average WR is far higher than the Standard B’s, but its playerbase is far better too – on average. when the differences in the playerbase are taken into account, the difference becomes small and to the Standard B\u0026rsquo;s advantage. The difference IS statistically significant See significance testing below.\nPremium tanks and new higher tier tank lines are often played by better players than average. This distorts the average WR of those tanks and makes people regard the tanks as OP whereas the fundamental reason can be that the tanks are just being played by better players. Yes, there are many borderline-OP \u0026amp; ridiculously-broken premium tanks, but the Relative WR analysis allows us to separate tank performance from skill-level differences in the tanks’ playerbases.\n  Testing for Statistical significance   From statistical perspective the Standard B performs better than the AMX on average. p-value 0.0024 way below the limit 0.05 (95% confidence level).\n## ## Welch Two Sample t-test\r## ## data: res[Tank == tanks.post.200608.tank_perf[[1]], `Relative WR`] and res[Tank == tanks.post.200608.tank_perf[[2]], `Relative WR`]\r## t = 3.033, df = 4669.7, p-value = 0.002434\r## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0\r## 95 percent confidence interval:\r## 0.1365480 0.6357204\r## sample estimates:\r## mean of x mean of y ## 0.4876500 0.1015158\r## p-value: 0.0024\r## Null hypothesis of the tanks's Relative WR being equal has to be rejected (i.e. there is a statistically significant difference at 95% confidence level\r   TL;DR: Relative WR measures how much higher/lower WR players achieve in a tank vs. their average WR at the same tier.\nOK, is this wall of text over now? Nope.\nPerformance within player skill category The data shows that the Standard B’s Relative WR is slightly higher than the AMX 30 1er prototype’s – on average - although the difference is not strictly statistically significant. The caveat here is the words on average. How about performance in the hands of below/above average players? Some tanks are known to be difficult for less-skilled players, but well performing in the hands of more skilled players.\nLet’s see how the Standard B and the AMX perform when played by different player skill categories.\nPerformance in the hands of super-good players (WR at tier \u0026gt;70%)    Tank Relative WR Players     AMX 30 1er prototype 0.1 184   Prototipo Standard B 0.6 98    Standard B seems to perform better than the AMX in the hands of super-good players. However, the player sample is on the small side and the difference is not statistically significant (see below).\n  Testing for Statistical significance   ## ## Welch Two Sample t-test\r## ## data: res[Tank == tanks.post.200608.tank_perf[[1]], `Relative WR`] and res[Tank == tanks.post.200608.tank_perf[[2]], `Relative WR`]\r## t = 0.85015, df = 182.12, p-value = 0.3964\r## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0\r## 95 percent confidence interval:\r## -0.7345746 1.8468340\r## sample estimates:\r## mean of x mean of y ## 0.62333215 0.06720244\r## p-value: 0.4\r## [1] \u0026quot;Null hypothesis of the tanks's Relative WR being equal cannot be rejected (i.e. there is not statistically significant difference at 95% confidence level \\n\u0026quot;\r   Performance in the hands of very good players (WR at tier 60-70%)    Tank Relative WR Players     Prototipo Standard B 0.3 739   AMX 30 1er prototype 0.3 755    When considering only players with 60-70% WR at tier IX, we can see how the tide has changed and the AMX is performing little bit better than the Standard B, but the margin is miniscule. The p-value is 0.94 so the difference is not statistically significant at any reasonable confidence level.\n  Testing for Statistical significance   ## ## Welch Two Sample t-test\r## ## data: res[Tank == tanks.post.200608.tank_perf[[1]], `Relative WR`] and res[Tank == tanks.post.200608.tank_perf[[2]], `Relative WR`]\r## t = -0.077832, df = 1492, p-value = 0.938\r## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0\r## 95 percent confidence interval:\r## -0.5570840 0.5145627\r## sample estimates:\r## mean of x mean of y ## 0.2562778 0.2775385\r## p-value: 0.94\r## Null hypothesis of the tanks's Relative WR being equal cannot be rejected (i.e. there is not statistically significant difference at 95% confidence level\r   Performance in the hands of good players (WR at tier 50-60%)    Tank Relative WR Players     Prototipo Standard B 0.5 2730   AMX 30 1er prototype 0.3 1130    For this player category the results have reversed again, and Standard B performs bit better vs. the AMX. This is a large player category in the overall dataset, but still the difference is not statistically significant.\n  Testing for Statistical significance   ## ## Welch Two Sample t-test\r## ## data: res[Tank == tanks.post.200608.tank_perf[[1]], `Relative WR`] and res[Tank == tanks.post.200608.tank_perf[[2]], `Relative WR`]\r## t = 1.4182, df = 1852.6, p-value = 0.1563\r## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0\r## 95 percent confidence interval:\r## -0.1118612 0.6961485\r## sample estimates:\r## mean of x mean of y ## 0.5441002 0.2519566\r## p-value: 0.16\r## Null hypothesis of the tanks's Relative WR being equal cannot be rejected (i.e. there is not statistically significant difference at 95% confidence level\r   Performance in the hands of below-average players (WR at tier 40-50%)    Tank Relative WR Players     Prototipo Standard B 0.5 2160   AMX 30 1er prototype -0.4 502    When analyzing players with 40-50% WR at tier IX, Standard B performance clearly better. Considering that this is a large player group, it is easy to understand why Standard B’s average Relative WR is higher than the AMX’s. My guess is that it is the Standard B’s burst DPM that helps the below average players, where as AMX requires more skill in e.g. ridge fighting to perform, even it is a very good tank in the hands of a skilled player. Also, for this player group, the difference in Relative WR is statistically significant.\n  Testing for Statistical significance   ## ## Welch Two Sample t-test\r## ## data: res[Tank == tanks.post.200608.tank_perf[[1]], `Relative WR`] and res[Tank == tanks.post.200608.tank_perf[[2]], `Relative WR`]\r## t = 3.243, df = 711.21, p-value = 0.001238\r## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0\r## 95 percent confidence interval:\r## 0.3310788 1.3469827\r## sample estimates:\r## mean of x mean of y ## 0.4865005 -0.3525303\r## p-value: 0.0012\r## Null hypothesis of the tanks's Relative WR being equal has to be rejected (i.e. there is a statistically significant difference at 95% confidence level\r   Performance in the hands of well below-average players (WR at tier \u0026lt;40%)    Tank Relative WR Players     Prototipo Standard B 0.5 209   AMX 30 1er prototype -0.8 79    Here the difference in Relative WR turns even larger between the tanks. Standard B seems to perform significantly better for players with below-average skills. Again, I suspect the reason being the burst damage. Even the sample size is getting small the difference IS statistically significant.\n  Testing for Statistical significance   ## ## Welch Two Sample t-test\r## ## data: res[Tank == tanks.post.200608.tank_perf[[1]], `Relative WR`] and res[Tank == tanks.post.200608.tank_perf[[2]], `Relative WR`]\r## t = 2.1003, df = 153.09, p-value = 0.03734\r## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0\r## 95 percent confidence interval:\r## 0.07633056 2.49368912\r## sample estimates:\r## mean of x mean of y ## 0.5175338 -0.7674761\r## p-value: 0.037\r## Null hypothesis of the tanks's Relative WR being equal has to be rejected (i.e. there is a statistically significant difference at 95% confidence level\r   Final words As you can see, the question of tanks’ performance is not that straightforward. Even though average WR is such a common measure for tanks\u0026rsquo; performance, it fails to separate the impact of the different playerbases from the underlying tank performance. And even when comparing tank’s (average) Relative WR it only answers to the question in average – not for very good player or well-below average player.\nTo understand how does a tank perform in the hands of certain skill-level players, the Relative WR analysis can still come handy as it can be run for a specific skill-level players only. Again, the numbers are averages and there are always players who are relatively better on one tank vs other. But the Relative WR analysis per skill-level can help a player to choose tanks they are more likely to perform better with.\nIn case of the AMX 30 1er prototype and Standard B, the differences between the tank performance are mostly insignificant, but not far from being statistically significant. As anyone skilled player who has played those, both the tanks are good. I would call it a draw here since there are far larger imbalances in the game.\nThe graph below shows Relative WR for both the tanks as a function of players’ average WR at the tier (IX). The grey area shows the share of players with particular WR at the tier in the dataset. Small sample sizes are likely to cause errors in both the ends of the graph.\nI find it surprising there were differences between the tanks’ performance in the 60-70% and 70%+ WR player segments. What may explain the result is the fact that player skill follows broadly normal distribution, thus there are more players with (tier) WR closer to 50% than further away from it. Therefore the 60-70% WR player segment consist of mostly 60-65% players vs. 65-70% players. And there is quite a difference skill still between 60-65% and 70%+ players as I can observe every time I watch e.g. Juicy Tender Steak or Sk8xtrm playing tanks.\nThat’s all folks – this time\n"

Was T92E1 still one of the best performing tier IX tanks?\nI also discovered a bug in the code (function params in wrong order) that has likely impact the earlier results to some extend by filtering out too many results. Fixed now after several hours of debugging\u0026hellip;\n"
